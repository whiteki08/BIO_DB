00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,100
HAZEL SIVE: Let's move on
with Biochemistry III.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,620
And we have, as you recall,
being exploring the

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,090
fascinating and complicated
set of

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,930
macromolecules inside a cell--

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,320
inside the cell that we're
using, in a way, analogous to

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,100
a factory that is a production
line for synthesis of various

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,680
components that are required for
function of the cell, for

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,580
its replication, and for
perpetuation of the organism.

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,310
Today I want to talk to you
about some parameters that

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,693
surround the chemical reactions
of biochemistry.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,110
We'll talk briefly about
thermodynamics and energy

12
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,160
considerations.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,350
And then I want to introduce
you to a huge and pivotal

14
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,750
class of proteins,
the enzymes.

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,400
And then we'll talk very briefly
about the currency of

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,530
energy in the cell.

17
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,350
Let's start with thermodynamics,
which we will

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,870
define as the rules
underlying energy

19
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,020
usage in chemical reactions.

20
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,310
Rules underlying energy use.

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,410
And really, it's the first law
of thermodynamics that we're

22
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,250
interested in.

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,160
We're interested in the fact
that energy is neither created

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,740
nor destroyed, that it is
converted from one form to

25
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,220
another and that there is
conservation of energy.

26
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,840
And the other laws are embedded
in what we'll talk,

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,860
but these are the ones that
are really important for

28
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,110
biochemistry.

29
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,120
Let's think about a basic
chemical reaction, some kind

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,370
of substrate.

31
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,660
That's a biological term
which we'll use.

32
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,180
It's equivalent to the term
"reactant." And I could use R,

33
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,890
but I'm going to use S, because
that's what we'll use

34
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,950
in biochemistry, in life.

35
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,280
And that gives rise
to a product.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,610
And chemical reactions can
go in both directions.

37
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,690
One reaction may predominate
over the other.

38
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,810
But the reaction
is reversible.

39
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,220
And the questions that we're
going to ask is, does a

40
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:41,110
chemical reaction require
or release energy?

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,640
How fast does the
reaction go--

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,410
which is referred to as the
rate of the reaction.

43
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:15,180
And how far, which refers to
the equilibrium point.

44
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:23,690
Equilibrium, where equilibrium
is defined as the place where

45
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,940
the forward rate and the
back rate are equal.

46
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,970
And at equilibrium, even though
the forward and the

47
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,500
back rate are equal, it's not
that you have equal amounts of

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,580
substrate and product, you have
a particular ratio of

49
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,980
substrate to product that is
characteristic for the

50
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,990
chemical reaction.

51
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,320
So you get a specific substrate
or reactant to

52
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,100
product ratio.

53
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,290
Let's make this S a little
larger, to match

54
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,700
the P. There we go.

55
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,310
Good.

56
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,700
The thing that you need to
know is called Gibbs free

57
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,440
energy and the change in Gibbs
free energy with a reaction.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,500
So in any chemical reaction,
there are a couple of kinds of

59
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,580
energy considerations.

60
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,100
The one important for us is G,
the Gibbs free energy, which

61
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:49,650
is the usable or, the convention
is, free energy.

62
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,580
The other term you need
is H, which is the

63
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,940
total energy, or enthalpy.

64
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,655
Entropy, S, the unusable
energy.

65
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,290
And you also need T, which is
the temperature in absolute

66
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,510
degrees Kelvin.

67
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,870
And the reaction that you may
be familiar with or the

68
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:24,090
equation you may be familiar
with is delta G equals delta H

69
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,020
minus T delta S. And the thing
that's important here is what

70
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,390
this means.

71
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:38,000
Delta G is the change
in free energy

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,365
with a chemical reaction.

73
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,770
And every chemical reaction has
a characteristic change in

74
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,210
free energy.

75
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,350
And depending on what that is,
one can say certain things

76
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,640
about how likely the reaction
is to proceed.

77
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,260
If delta G is negative for a
particular chemical reaction,

78
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:20,710
then as the reaction proceeds,
energy is released, the

79
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,460
reaction is termed exergonic,
and it is sometimes

80
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,810
"spontaneous." I'm going
to put that in quotes.

81
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,060
You'll see why in a moment.

82
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,085
The flip is true if delta
G is positive.

83
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,990
This means that the reaction
requires energy in order to

84
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,640
proceed, and it is referred
to as endergonic.

85
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,770
And if delta G is 0, the
reaction is at equilibrium.

86
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,120
The notion that's quite useful
to think about this is balls

87
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,400
rolling up and down hills.

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,390
For a reaction that is
exergonic, a ball rolling down

89
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,280
a hill will decrease its delta
G. It will release energy as

90
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,830
it rolls down the hill.

91
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,590
And you can actually
plot this.

92
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,850
And you'll see lots of plots
like this where, if you plot

93
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,090
energy over the course of the
reaction, you will see that

94
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,220
the reactants start
off at a higher

95
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,820
energy than the products.

96
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,300
And as they are rolling
down the hill,

97
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,930
there is energy released.

98
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,060
And the flip is true for an
endergonic reaction where

99
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,600
delta G is positive.

100
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,070
You have to put in energy
to get the product out.

101
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,670
Now--

102
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,540
and this is where it
gets interesting.

103
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,860
And this is where we get back
to "spontaneous" in quotes--

104
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,800
chemical reactions can be
exergonic, but they may not

105
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,850
proceed spontaneously.

106
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,330
If you imagine a ball sitting
at the top of a hill, if the

107
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,440
ball is sitting right on the
slope of a hill, and you let

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,550
the ball go, it'll go zipping
down the hill, right?

109
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,710
But if the ball is sitting on
the top of the hill, but it's

110
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,720
in a little hollow, it's not
going to go anywhere unless

111
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,030
you give a push.

112
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,230
That's very important.

113
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,310
And that kind of notion is
embodied in chemical

114
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,460
principles.

115
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,220
So let's write this out.

116
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,400
And then we'll formalize this.

117
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:10,805
Delta G can be negative, but a
reaction does not proceed.

118
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,780
And that's because you've got
to get the reactants out of

119
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,310
that little hollow at
the top of the hill.

120
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,300
And in order to get the
reactants out of the little

121
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,740
hollow at the top of the hill,
you need something called

122
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,990
activation energy.

123
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:47,360
Activation energy is required.

124
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,780
I'm going to abbreviate
that AC.

125
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:58,836
You can abbreviate it
whatever you like.

126
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:02,560
And the thing about chemical
reactions that makes them

127
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,840
proceed in chemistry and makes
them proceed in biochemistry,

128
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,890
in life, is that you need
something to overcome that

129
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,560
activation energy.

130
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,180
Back to the ball analogy--

131
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,580
I think of this because
I have a dog.

132
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,400
His name is Archer.

133
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
He's a black Labrador--

134
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,290
in case you're interested--

135
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,240
and he's very fond of balls.

136
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,500
And they sit at the top of
the hill in my yard.

137
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,900
And there's a whole
line of them .

138
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,100
And they will sit there forever
unless Archer either

139
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,890
intelligently or by mistake
pushes one.

140
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,270
And then it goes rolling down
the hill, and he can get it.

141
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,860
So you have to do something
to start the reaction.

142
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,450
You have to give energy.

143
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,000
Where does that energy
come from?

144
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,030
Well, it comes from somewhere.

145
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,090
And you can decrease that
activation energy and really

146
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,160
get a reaction to proceed
quickly by the use of

147
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,070
chemicals called catalysts.

148
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:12,640
So catalysts decrease activation
energy and allow a

149
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,460
reaction to proceed.

150
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:27,230
Catalysts do not change delta G
of the whole reaction or the

151
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,495
equilibrium point.

152
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,800
So you're not going
to get more.

153
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,930
You're not going to really
change the reaction.

154
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,140
You're just going
to get it to go.

155
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:52,460
Catalysts do increase the
rate of reaction.

156
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,710
That's the point.

157
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,910
And they do this, as we'll
explore, by promoting

158
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,470
something called a transition
state, which is a high-energy

159
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,640
form of the reactants.

160
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,310
If we go back to our ball
analogy, if you kick the ball

161
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,120
so that it comes up out of the
hollow, that kick that you

162
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,370
give the ball, the energy you
put in there, is going to get

163
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,040
the ball rolling down
the hill, and the

164
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,600
reaction will proceed.

165
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:37,720
So catalysts promote a
transition state, which is a

166
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:46,065
high-energy form of
the reactants.

167
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,170
Let's look at a couple of slides
that I drew for you.

168
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,690
So here is a blank chart.

169
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,080
And I've got delta G on the
y-axis and the reaction course

170
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,510
on the x-axis.

171
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,110
And here's a reaction curve.

172
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,000
The reaction overall is going
to have a delta G that's

173
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,650
negative because you see that
the products are at the bottom

174
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,470
of the hill, relative
to the reactants.

175
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,320
But there's also this hump that
they have to get over.

176
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,285
And that is what requires
activation energy.

177
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,690
In an uncatalyzed reaction or a
catalyzed reaction, you have

178
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,900
to go through this high-energy
state.

179
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,860
So here is a catalyzed reaction
that I put on as

180
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,630
blue, the uncatalyzed as red.

181
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,130
And you can see what happens to
the little hill that has to

182
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,090
be climbed before the reaction
can proceed.

183
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,970
The amount of energy you need to
move that chemical reaction

184
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,820
decreases relative to the
uncatalyzed reaction.

185
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,830
So you decrease the little
hollow in which the ball is

186
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,470
sitting, in order to get the
reaction to proceed.

187
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,700
But at the end, you'll end up
with exactly the same reaction

188
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,065
as you would have if it
were not catalyzed.

189
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,260
All right.

190
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,090
What does this have to
do with biology?

191
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,450
Well, it has everything.

192
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,510
Because there's a class of
proteins that we'll talk about

193
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,720
for the rest of the lecture that
are biological catalysts.

194
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,885
And without them, there
would be no life.

195
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,090
So number two, we'll
talk about enzymes.

196
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,565
And enzymes are biological
catalysts.

197
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,900
They are usually protein.

198
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,060
And all of the ones that we'll
talk about are proteins.

199
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,410
But they can also be RNA.

200
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,270
And a Nobel Prize was given
some years ago for the

201
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,050
discovery of RNA enzymes
that are catalysts.

202
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,940
And Dr. Sinha has posted on
the website a video of the

203
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,190
Nobel lecture of Professor
Sidney Altman, who got the

204
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,180
Nobel Prize for the discovery
of RNAs as enzymes.

205
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,280
But we're going to focus
on proteins.

206
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,250
We're going to rewrite the
chemical reaction that I have

207
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,380
on that board in a slightly
different way, which is the

208
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,690
conventional way for thinking
about enzymes, where we're

209
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:48,250
going to have an enzyme,
abbreviated E, plus the

210
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,510
substrate that is
going to form an

211
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,020
enzyme-substrate complex.

212
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,080
And this is the transition
state, so called

213
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,696
transition-state complex.

214
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,190
And that, as I'll draw in a
moment, is going to give rise

215
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,680
to the enzyme plus
the product.

216
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,560
So let me just draw
this up there.

217
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,050
And then we'll talk about
what these mean.

218
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:23,290
E is enzyme, S is substrate,
as previously.

219
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,790
This enzyme substrate, ES, is
the transition-state complex.

220
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,850
And what it is in biological
terms is some kind of

221
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,850
high-energy state of the
substrate that is linked to

222
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,100
the enzyme.

223
00:17:50,570 --> 00:18:02,060
So it's a high-energy substrate

224
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,310
linked to the enzyme.

225
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,250
This transition-state complex
then resolves to release the

226
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,460
enzyme, which can
be used again.

227
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,030
As in the case of all catalysts,
they can be reused

228
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,415
to give rise to the enzyme
and the product.

229
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,352
So why is this interesting?

230
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,602
It's fascinating because --

231
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,120
Actually, let me before I tell
you why it's so fascinating,

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,370
let me show you something.

233
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,290
So I drew this for you.

234
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,370
Here is a representation of an
enzyme and something I'll

235
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,090
explore on the board in a moment
called the active site,

236
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,380
where the substrate fits
into the enzyme.

237
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,830
Here is an enzyme-substrate
complex, a high-energy

238
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:07,760
transition-state complex, that
undergoes reaction, catalysis,

239
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
to give rise to the product.

240
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,050
The product is released,
and you start

241
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,460
the whole thing again.

242
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,160
The thing about biological
catalysts that are really

243
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,700
different from chemical
catalysts is their

244
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,190
specificity.

245
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,640
Now, you may have heard of
platinum as a catalyst.

246
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,900
Platinum is an incredibly
powerful catalyst that

247
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,220
promotes almost any
chemical reaction

248
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,270
that involves hydrogen--

249
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,870
but any chemical reaction.

250
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,260
The difference between platinum
and enzymes is that

251
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,870
enzymes are incredibly specific
for a particular

252
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,270
chemical reaction.

253
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,530
Let's write that.

254
00:19:51,530 --> 00:20:06,130
Enzymes are highly specific,
exquisitely specific, for the

255
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,380
particular reaction.

256
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,270
And they maintain this
specificity by fitting the

257
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,890
substrate into what I've got
on the screen there, the

258
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,230
active site, which is a
particular part of the enzyme,

259
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,890
a particular part
of the protein.

260
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:35,250
And the deal is that the
substrate fits into a part of

261
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,240
the protein called
the active site.

262
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,830
The active site is a very small
part of the protein.

263
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,110
And it's this interaction with
the protein and the active

264
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,545
site that promotes the
transition state.

265
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,610
How does it promote the
transition state?

266
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,610
Well, you can think physically
it might change the shape of

267
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,180
the substrate to make
it higher energy.

268
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,440
You could imagine
it adds charge.

269
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,600
You could imagine it adds
particular orientation between

270
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,540
two substrate molecules
that happen to be

271
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,600
in the active site.

272
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,560
Or it might align the substrate
in the correct way.

273
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,420
So we can actually say that the
substrate is promoted to

274
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,920
undergo catalysis
by controlling--

275
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,940
let's just list these--

276
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,550
orientation of the substrate
in the access site, adding

277
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,520
strain to the substrate, or
possibly adding a particular

278
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,700
charge to the substrate.

279
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,640
Let's look through a couple
of things here.

280
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,780
Okay, this is from your book.

281
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,330
Let's not dwell on that.

282
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,780
Let's go to this one,
which is not quite--

283
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,560
Ah, it's on that screen.

284
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,400
Good.

285
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,010
This is an example of enzyme
specificity that you see every

286
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,680
day, probably.

287
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,570
On Diet Coke, it says,
"warning, fennel

288
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,440
phenylketonurics, contains

289
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
phenylalanine." What's the deal?

290
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,480
There is a disorder called
phenylketonuria where people

291
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,220
are unable to digest the amino
acid phenylalanine.

292
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,730
This is an essential
amino acid, but too

293
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,420
much of it is bad.

294
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,820
Normally when you eat
phenylalanine, you use some of

295
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,970
it to build proteins.

296
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,070
That's good.

297
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,070
But then you convert a bunch
of it, using this enzyme

298
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,990
called phenylalanine
hydroxylase, into tyrosine,

299
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,660
which you may remember is
another amino acid.

300
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,730
And then you use tyrosine.

301
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,130
And tyrosine goes on to do
a bunch of other things.

302
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,090
If this enzyme is absent, then
you get a side product whereby

303
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,830
the excess phenylalanine
makes this stuff called

304
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,770
phenylpyruvic acid.

305
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,620
And that is a neurotoxin.

306
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,160
And it poisons the nervous
system, and people have very

307
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,150
severe symptoms.

308
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,690
People with phenylketonuria
generally have a single amino

309
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,790
acid change in an enzyme that
is more than 1,000 amino

310
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,390
acids, where there's an arginine
that has being

311
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,850
changed to a tryptophan.

312
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,930
And the single amino
acid change lies

313
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,620
in the active site.

314
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,600
It stops the phenylalanine from
binding the active site.

315
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,480
And it leads to this really
debilitating disorder.

316
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,770
And so that's an everyday
example of a single tiny

317
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,180
change that reflects
the specificity of

318
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,430
the particular enzyme.

319
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,520
But here's a puzzle.

320
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,210
This is a space-filling
model of an enzyme,

321
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,200
taken from your book.

322
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,730
Here's a substrate in red.

323
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,930
And you can see that this
enzyme has 3D shape.

324
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,210
Each of these bubbles is part
of one of the amino acids.

325
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,900
That's what a space-filling
model is.

326
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,980
And the substrate fits into
this active site.

327
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,590
I think this is called
hexokinase.

328
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,120
And you can see as the substrate
enters the active

329
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,310
site, actually the protein
changes shape.

330
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,630
And it kind of closes up and
contains the substrate in the

331
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,410
active site.

332
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,100
And catalysis takes place.

333
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,130
But the active site is tiny.

334
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,630
And there's this huge
rest of the protein.

335
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,940
And you can't get rid of the
rest of the protein.

336
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,920
The enzyme doesn't function
if you do.

337
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,680
So there's a fundamental
question that we need to ask,

338
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,820
which is, what do the rest of
proteins do, the part outside

339
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,070
the active site?

340
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,180
So let's ask that question.

341
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:34,750
What does the rest of the
protein, which is large, do?

342
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,960
And by the rest of the protein,
I mean "not the

343
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:45,880
active site," which is the place
where the transition

344
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,900
state complex is promoted.

345
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,220
What it does is to regulate the
activity of the enzyme.

346
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,270
So the answer we can give
is that it regulates, or

347
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,945
controls, activity
of the enzyme.

348
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,460
What do I mean?

349
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,060
Well, if you go back to this
notion of the cell as a

350
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,840
factory and enzymes as the
wheels and the machines that

351
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,740
get things done so that you
get particular components

352
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,415
synthesized, then you really
want to make sure that you

353
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:28,860
have got your production line
working at the right pace.

354
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,860
If you need more product,
you need to speed up.

355
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,910
If you need less product,
you need to slow down.

356
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,030
The enzymes are a place where
you control how much product

357
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,360
is being made, how much reactant
is being used, how

358
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,500
much substrate is being used.

359
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,250
So the rest of the protein
controls the

360
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,750
activity of the enzyme.

361
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,010
And there are a couple of ways
that this activity is

362
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,380
controlled.

363
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:04,500
The end result is that all of
these regulations affect the

364
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:11,260
active site, even if they
happen far, far away.

365
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,000
And so you can imagine that if
you are all lined up in a

366
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,700
line, and the active site was
right at the front of the line

367
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,250
of you that was the enzyme
prototype, and I pushed you,

368
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,860
and you all fell down, the
active site, the very front of

369
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,460
the line, would eventually be
affected although I'd pushed

370
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,020
the back of the line.

371
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,970
It's a silly example, but it
gives you a sense of how you

372
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,160
can change one thing and it
has an effect far away.

373
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,930
And the way that this is done
is through the use of

374
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,170
inhibitors.

375
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,440
I'll go through some
slides in a moment.

376
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,030
And there are two kinds
of inhibitors.

377
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,790
There are reversible inhibitors,
and there are

378
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,050
irreversible inhibitors.

379
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,570
These inhibitors may be
competitive inhibitors.

380
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,170
If they are competitive, they
actually will bind to the

381
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,930
active site as opposed to
the rest of the protein.

382
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:34,470
But if they are all of a class
that is non-competitive, they

383
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,325
will bind to the protein
elsewhere.

384
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,610
I'll show you a slide
in a minute.

385
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,370
But let's finish doing
some board work

386
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,700
here before I do that.

387
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,920
There is also a very important
and interesting class of

388
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,750
enzyme regulators called
allosteric regulators.

389
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:04,210
There are both allosteric
activators of enzyme function

390
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:11,250
or inhibitors, things that will
increase or decrease the

391
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,040
rate of the reaction.

392
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,540
And these allosteric activators
or inhibitors will

393
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:22,170
bind to a particular site that's
not the active site.

394
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,380
It's called an allosteric
site--

395
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,060
not the active site, but another
particular place on

396
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,310
the enzyme.

397
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,840
Other things that can change
enzyme function--

398
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,690
pH, the enzymes that work in
your stomach to digest your

399
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,750
food work at a pH of 2.

400
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,310
That's the pH in your stomach.

401
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,730
It's very acid.

402
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,930
Those enzymes will not work in
your small intestine, which is

403
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,430
at a pH of about 6 or 7.

404
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,940
So pH, physiologically, can
affect how enzymes work.

405
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:10,680
Temperature affects
how enzymes work.

406
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,100
And all of these things are
somehow changing the structure

407
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,440
of the protein.

408
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,260
And changing the structure
of the protein is

409
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,520
changing its function.

410
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,090
We'll explore this in more
specifics as the semester goes

411
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,390
by, but this is what you
need to understand now.

412
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:33,710
There are also classes of
molecules called cofactors,

413
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:39,685
coenzymes, and prosthetic
groups.

414
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,270
I'll go through one of
these in a moment.

415
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,750
But all of these things
have the outcome--

416
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:06,320
all change the structure of the
protein so they'll change

417
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,570
enzyme structure.

418
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,115
And with that, they will
change enzyme function.

419
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,900
So all of these things--

420
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,550
I'm going to put it in a box--

421
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,370
change the structure
of the protein.

422
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,450
They will change the structure
of the enzyme,

423
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,830
of the active site.

424
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,690
And they will change
its function.

425
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,220
And they're very complicated
to think about.

426
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,445
Let's go through some slides
that will help us with this.

427
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,920
Here's the notion of a
competitive inhibitor.

428
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,750
Here's the substrate
and an active site.

429
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,050
And here's an inhibitor.

430
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,820
And you can see I've drawn it so
that it kind of looks like

431
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,990
a substrate, but it's got
some extra stuff.

432
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,530
And so when it binds to the
active site, it binds

433
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,960
specifically.

434
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,250
But it's not actually a
substrate, because it's got

435
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,490
this extra chemical moiety
which does not make it

436
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,270
available for catalysis.

437
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,480
And that stops the enzyme.

438
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,770
That competitive inhibitor may
or may not be able to come off

439
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,970
the enzyme and allow
it to work again.

440
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,180
It depends on the inhibitor.

441
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,480
Here's another one, a
noncompetitive inhibitor that

442
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,080
doesn't look like a substrate
and binds somewhere else on

443
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,450
the enzyme and, in doing so,
changes the shape of the

444
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,800
active site.

445
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,730
So the active site now can't
bind the substrate anymore

446
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,260
because its shape has
being changed.

447
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,710
Here's the notion of an
allosteric activator.

448
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,850
Here's the enzyme, and here's
the enzyme with its substrate.

449
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,620
And here's its allosteric
site.

450
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,600
And it can't work until an
allosteric activator, which is

451
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,620
not the substrate--

452
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,230
it's a different molecule--

453
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,080
binds to the allosteric site and
then makes the active site

454
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,270
the correct shape to fit
the substrate so that

455
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,720
the enzyme can work.

456
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,170
And you can get a cycle here
again, so that you get

457
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,260
catalysis, and the whole thing
can take place again.

458
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,120
I want to show you, to give
you a sense of the kind of

459
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,390
complexity of what this all
looks like, a particular

460
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,870
example of an enzyme reaction.

461
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,930
And I'll show you an animation
that goes with this, to give

462
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,040
you a sense of how these
things work.

463
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,850
The enzyme I'm going to
focus on is called

464
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,980
dihydrofolate reductase.

465
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,380
That's an essential enzyme.

466
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,530
It's required for nucleotide
synthesis, DNA modification.

467
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,100
And the reason you take folate,
or folic acid, is to

468
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
allow dihydrofolate to
actually work --

469
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,570
dihydrofolate reductase
to work.

470
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,850
The substrate is
dihydrofolate.

471
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,560
It's a complicated molecule.

472
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,490
But I've circled the
important part.

473
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,770
You can see there's a double
bond here which is going to be

474
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,560
reduced when the enzyme acts.

475
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,060
And here is the reduced form
or tetrahydrofolate of

476
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,540
dihydrofolate reductase.

477
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,880
You don't need to take
notes on this.

478
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,570
Just look and listen.

479
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,690
Here is a structure
of the protein.

480
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,989
You can see the alpha helices
in brown and the beta sheets

481
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,760
in blue and this kind
of unstructured

482
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,280
loopy stuff in between.

483
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,129
And here is the substrate
dihydrofolate binding to its

484
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:39,570
active site.

485
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,739
Dihydrofolate reductase requires
a coenzyme, something

486
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,719
called NADPH, which is a very
important coenzyme.

487
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,420
It's also part of the energy
production cycle.

488
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,739
And dihydrofolate reductase is
not only essential for life

489
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,040
but it's a target of the
anticancer drug methotrexate

490
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,205
and of trimethoprim, which
is an antibiotic.

491
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,150
This is an animation which
will show you how

492
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,380
dihydrofolate binds to
dihydrofolate reductase, how

493
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,840
NADPH comes in, and how NADPH
donates the hydrogens that

494
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,750
will allow dihydrofolate
to be reduced.

495
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,890
So let me start the animation,
and I'll point things out as

496
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,090
you're watching it.

497
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,830
And you'll see it's quick.

498
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,750
Here is the coenzyme
coming in.

499
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,540
And here is the substrate
dihydrofolate.

500
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,230
And if you look at it, you'll
see that the coenzyme is near

501
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,130
the active site.

502
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,690
And as it binds first, donates
its hydrogens to

503
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:52,070
dihydrofolate, which then
becomes tetrahydrofolate, is

504
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,010
released from the enzyme.

505
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,860
There are a number of things
you can see here.

506
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,730
You can see the enzyme cycle.

507
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,610
You can see this goes
over and over again.

508
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,050
You can see that the
enzyme, the protein

509
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,570
structure, is changing.

510
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,400
It's moving as the coenzyme
is binding, as the

511
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,250
substrate is binding.

512
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,000
You can see that there's a
chemical reaction going on

513
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,270
here as the NADPH is giving
its hydrogens to this

514
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,760
dihydrofolate.

515
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,240
And you can get a sense
of the kind of

516
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,440
animation that is enzymes.

517
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,830
This is an animation.

518
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,580
No one's actually seen an enzyme
work like this because

519
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,460
it's impossible to take
real movies like this.

520
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,190
But based on the structure of
the enzyme and the binding of

521
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,910
NADPH and the substrate to the
enzyme, these authors have

522
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,480
reconstructed this really
beautiful movie which gives

523
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,560
you a sense how enzymes
work in action.

524
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,950
Okay.

525
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,410
I'll post this on
your website.

526
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,660
And you can watch it.

527
00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:00,210
The last two things I want to
tell you are that, firstly,

528
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,520
enzymes don't work
as one-off deals.

529
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,410
They work as part of
a production line.

530
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,430
And the production line
is called a pathway.

531
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,070
And like any good production
line, as I've mentioned

532
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,360
already, there are checks and
balances to make sure that the

533
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,190
production line is working at
optimal speed and making what

534
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,530
it needs to make.

535
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:27,756
So we can talk about pathways
and feedback.

536
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,000
And let's draw a simple pathway
on the board to give

537
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,960
you a sense of what I mean.

538
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,030
Let's start off with a substrate
that's converted

539
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:47,390
through the action of enzyme
one to product one.

540
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,670
And then there is also a
competing pathway where this--

541
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,290
Actually, lets make
it product one.

542
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,885
Or we can call it
substrate two.

543
00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:01,080
But let's call it product one,
and then through the action of

544
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,230
enzyme two, to product one.

545
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,890
And here's a competing pathway
where the substrate, through

546
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,560
the action of enzyme three makes
product three, and then

547
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,340
through enzyme four action,
makes product four.

548
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,410
Okay.

549
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,400
This is a pathway.

550
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,660
It's a bifurcating pathway.

551
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:29,430
It may be that's if you've got
this branch, the E3-E4 branch

552
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,020
of the pathway active, you
actually want to shut off

553
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,560
production of the
other pathway.

554
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,880
And it may be that if you get
product four made, you

555
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,950
actually want to shut off
production of product two.

556
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,820
In that case, you could draw a
line like this-- you could

557
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,440
make it up, whatever you like.

558
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,110
But for the example I'm giving
you, I'm telling you that when

559
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,910
you've got lots of product four,
it's going to shut off

560
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,370
the other branch
of the pathway.

561
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,000
And this nomenclature
is as follows.

562
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,955
An arrow means activate.

563
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,840
And what's called a T-bar
means inhibit.

564
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,570
And these are very standard
nomenclatures in biology that

565
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,270
you should know.

566
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,820
So this T-bar here is inhibit.

567
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,730
It's also called negative
feedback.

568
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,000
At the same time, you might
get positive feedback.

569
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,580
It may be that if you have some
of product three, you

570
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,570
actually want more
of product one.

571
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:54,390
And in that case, product three
might activate enzyme

572
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,180
one so that you actually
activate the other branch.

573
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,790
This is a complicated pathway.

574
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,510
There's a lot of competition
going on here.

575
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:08,420
But in that case, that
activation would be positive.

576
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,300
And so for this example,
my star

577
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,635
would be positive feedback.

578
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,470
And my T-bar, which I'll make
a pound sign, would be a

579
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,720
negative feedback.

580
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,610
This is a really pivotal
concept in biology.

581
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,570
It's not just true of enzyme
pathways, it's true of

582
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,790
multiple chemical reactions.

583
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,650
And you really need
to understand

584
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,790
this aspect of biology.

585
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:47,000
The last thing that I want to
tell you has to do, very

586
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,300
briefly, with where the energy
comes from that cells use for

587
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,500
chemical reactions.

588
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,300
And what I'm going to tell you
very briefly, in about two

589
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,020
seconds, is that in the cell,
there are very controlled

590
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,570
amounts of energy that are
contained in a nucleotide

591
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,880
called ATP.

592
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,350
ATP is a nucleotide
triphosphate.

593
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,030
We talked about nucleotides
before.

594
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,440
The triphosphate is very
important here.

595
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,110
And this nucleotide triphosphate
is kind of like

596
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,600
the dollars and cents of energy
currency in the cell.

597
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,760
If a chemical reaction needs
energy, the cell

598
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,390
uses ATP to get it.

599
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:50,890
ATP is hydrolyzed to give rise
to ADP, adenosine diphosphate,

600
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:57,060
and PPI, inorganic phosphate,
plus an increment of energy.

601
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,090
This is an exergonic reaction.

602
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:12,340
This energy is then used for
chemical reactions, to build

603
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,600
or to break down various
molecules.

604
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,210
For this reaction, delta
G is negative.

605
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,425
That is why there's
energy released.

606
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,860
And this energy is used for
two types of reactions--

607
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:42,600
those that are catabolic, that
break down molecules, and

608
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:52,320
those that are anabolic, which
build up molecules.

609
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,340
We're not going to talk about
generation of ATP.

610
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,640
That is a separate topic.

611
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,640
And those of you who are go on
to do biochemistry will talk

612
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,620
about it in great detail.

613
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,530
But I do have some slides on
here that I will refer to.

614
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:06,635
Here is --

615
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:08,820
This is the last thing
I'll show you.

616
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,140
Please wait for it.

617
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,800
Here is adenosine
triphosphate.

618
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,350
Here is the high-energy
bond that is

619
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,470
broken to release energy.

620
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,720
And we'll stop there.
