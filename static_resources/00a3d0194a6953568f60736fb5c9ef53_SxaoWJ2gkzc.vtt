WEBVTT

00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.370
So I need to move on a little
bit now, and I want to talk

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:24.540
about in fact, the earlier way
that nature developed to make

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.930
energy using proton gradients.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.940
And this part actually preceded
the development of

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.700
respiration as you'll see.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.930
It's what I somewhat flippantly
refer to as

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.970
photosynthesis release 1.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.060
In my first lecture,
when I was giving

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.180
you a sketch of evolution.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.480
Who knows, I mean these are very
rough numbers, but may

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.330
have evolved about $3.4 billion
years ago and early

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.715
life had begun to exhaust
this sea of chemicals

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.970
that had been produced.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.630
And it's known as cyclic
photophosphorylation.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690
And it's a way of taking
the energy in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.470
sunlight and making ATP.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.540
So whatever organism figured
this out, this was

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.590
a really big deal.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
Because now instead of having
to use the sort of natural

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.350
reserves like the way the food
around is a depleting resource

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.950
just like our petroleum
reserves, this was able to

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.780
take the abundantly-available
sunlight and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.280
use it to make energy.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840
So that's the principle.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.590
It uses the energy in sunlight,
and the way it does

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.580
it, is it uses the sunlight to
establish a proton gradient

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.290
just as we've been discussing
earlier, and then uses

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.160
that to make ATP.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.630
And there's a special molecule
that's involved in absorbing

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.620
the energy from the sunlight.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.560
We've all heard it I'm
sure, chlorophyll.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.870
There are a couple of two major

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.400
variants of this molecule.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.810
Here's one of them, chlorophyll
a, and you don't

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.150
have to memorize
the structure.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850
But I want you to notice
a couple of things.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.800
One is there's a metal in the
middle, a magnesium, and then

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.800
it's coordinated with the
cyclic ring system.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.780
And notice all the conjugated
double bonds.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.090
So this chlorophyll was tuned
to absorb energy from the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.845
visible range of sunlight.

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:03.510
And when it absorbs a photon
of energy, it kicks an

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.450
electron up to a
higher orbital.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.940
And if the electron's in a
higher orbital, it's more

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.130
easily lost.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.810
And this has a consequence.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.020
So the way this system works
is you have a molecule of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.580
chlorophyll, that's what
I'm abbreviating here.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.420
Oh, let me tell you something
else too.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.260
It's more sophisticated
than this.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.850
So this is the molecule that
absorbs a particular

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.650
wavelength from sunlight.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.910
But this is embedded in a
multi-protein structure that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.330
has a bunch of other molecules
that absorb at different

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.770
wavelengths and then funnel that
energy down to the one

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.810
the chlorophyll comes in.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.560
So in fact, the whole thing is
like a big antenna that's able

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.420
to absorb quite a bit of
energy from different

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.310
wavelengths in sunlight
and get it down to the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.470
chlorophyll.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.510
When the chlorophyll absorbs
energy, it goes up to an

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.670
excited state.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.910
And as I said, now that the
electron's in a higher

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.640
orbital, it's lost
more easily.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.649
So this has become a better
reducing agent.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.670
It's able to give its electrons
to things that it

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.450
couldn't do down in
this energy state.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.130
So we come down one of these
thermodynamic hills that

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.850
you're hopefully starting to
get used to where it comes

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.180
down in little hops to a carrier
that has this set

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.580
level of energy, down,
free energy, down.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.650
And similarly, to the principle
that we talked about

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.210
in respiration, a proton is
pumped from what I'm going to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.380
say, in this case, I'll show you
what I mean, but I'll say

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.140
from a proton that's out
to a proton that's in.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.310
And by doing that, it
establishes a proton gradient,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.230
and that gives rise to ATP.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.740
At the end of this cycle, we
have this chlorophyll minus

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.170
the electrons.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.070
These come, flow back.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.610
That's why it's called cyclic
photophosphorylation.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.330
The electrons go through these
carriers, and then they return

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.760
to chlorophyll.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.645
So wonderful system.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.670
I seemed to have accidentally
advanced this.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.260
OK.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.550
There are still bacteria around
that run this system.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.170
So if you remember, we talked
about biosynthesis, the need

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.625
for energy.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:57.390
Well, here we are.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.360
We got ATP.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.430
But there is something else
hopefully you now appreciate

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.400
in that is that ATP is not
enough to take carbon dioxide

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.030
and make it into sugars
or carbon compounds.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.190
We need a source of reducing
power as well.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.460
Because remember, carbon dioxide
is the most oxidized

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.140
form of carbon.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.080
So these early organism solved
it by making reducing power

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.450
from another source.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.260
Many of them used hydrogen
sulfide as a source, and they

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.150
used NADP plus.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.090
Now, this is a minor
variation of NADH.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.370
It's got one more
phosphate on it.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.730
You can look it up
in your book.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.440
This variant of NAD is used
preferentially for

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.880
biosynthetic purposes.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.660
But everything I've told you
about NAD in terms of banking

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.660
electrons applies here.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.500
So the electrons from
here are grabbed.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:06.640
The cell makes NADPH, which you
can use as reducing power

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.890
for biosynthesis.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.320
You get elemental sulfur
and hydrogen ions.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.160
So this process an organism
that used this kind of

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.680
photophosphorylation to make
ATP would get its reducing

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.930
power through a process
something like this.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.500
And then it could make sugars,
and then from that point on,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.170
they can be used to
make all the other

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.860
molecules that you need.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.170
The key thing is to get from the
carbon dioxide down into a

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.280
more reduced form of carbon.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.050
So that works pretty well.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.580
However, a better system came
up involved in evolution.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.180
This was the one I again
somewhat flippantly called

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.690
photosynthesis release 2,
when I was talking.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:14.380
This is known as, probably came
up who knows again but

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:27.900
maybe 3 billion years ago, and
it's known as noncyclic

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.530
photophosphorylation.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.750
And what's important about this
system and why it's an

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.270
improvement over the other, is
it uses the energy in sunlight

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.820
to make ATP just as we've
learned, but it also uses the

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.180
energy in sunlight
to make NADPH.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.010
So in other words, this second
version gives the cell simply

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.330
from the energy in sunlight
everything it needs to take

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.160
carbon dioxide and make it
into organic compounds.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.190
And it's a pretty cool system
evolutionarily.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.490
It's built on the older one,
the first arising one.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.350
You'll still see the elements of
the present but with a new

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.090
variation added in, very much
the way we do design when

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.795
you're doing engineering.

00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:19.770
You get something that's
working, and you can use that

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.820
as a basis to move to a new
and improved version.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.925
And naturally, if you get a new
and improved version, and

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:27.270
you get a little advantage over
your neighbors, natural

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.760
selection makes sure that
that better system gets

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.160
established.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.110
So here's here how
this noncyclic

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.890
photophosphorylation starts.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:45.535
We take a chlorophyll and it
absorbs the quantum of energy,

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:50.650
and it kicks itself up
to an excited state.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:56.230
The chlorophyll, as before,
electrons come down,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.760
energetically downhill and
remember that theme.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.150
I keep saying that's at least
thermodynamic properties.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.910
If we think about free energy,
it doesn't matter

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.920
what path you take.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.280
Whether you come shooting right
down or you come down

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.120
through it, you get the
same energy back.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.120
What's amazing about the system,
if it didn't have all

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.790
this extra apparatus, you'd kick
up the electron, and then

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.880
it would just come right back
and you'd get a little

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.130
radiated, a little
energy given off.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.480
We wouldn't have accomplished
anything.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.680
And what's terrific about this
photophosphorylation system,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.780
it's able to capture the energy
that's in that excited

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.780
chlorophyll.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:35.170
So at this point, and as it's
coming down as I said, we have

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.090
H plus going from H
plus, H plus in.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.090
I'll give you a picture of
what I mean by that.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.380
Then we're getting ATP made.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.920
So this time the difference is
instead of the electrons going

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.940
back to that chlorophyll, it was
missing its electrons, the

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.710
electrons, instead, go to a
chlorophyll, which is at a

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.000
somewhat higher energy level
than the first one.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.295
And it has just absorbed quantum
of energy, and it's

00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:16.720
kicked itself up to an even
more excited state.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.390
And these electrons from this
system come on and fill up

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.770
this chlorophyll.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:33.495
So this one over here is
called photosystem II.

00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:36.530
And the term used in the field
to describe what I'm about to

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:47.650
tell you here is now called
photosystem I.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:54.550
So what we have now from this
system is an excited molecule,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.190
chlorophyll, that's even more
excited than we were before.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.000
And so it's even more able to
give off its electrons.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.750
It has more reducing power.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.240
In fact, it has enough reducing
power that it can

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.440
reduce NADP.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:22.030
So NADP plus, electrons coming
downhill, you get NADPH.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:32.000
So here we are, reducing power
made by using the energy in

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.660
sunlight, ATP made using
the energy in sunlight.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.300
So by just using this noncyclic
photophosphorylation

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.930
system, the cell's got what it
needs to take carbon dioxide

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.740
and put it through a sequence of
reactions that will let it

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.600
make sugars and other things.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.020
In this course, I don't have
enough time to go through the

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.470
biosynthetic pathway.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.940
It's in your textbooks.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.455
You might find it interesting
to look at.

00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:04.490
We're not making a big
issue of it in there.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.500
But it exists, and you can see
that it obviously exists.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.550
So there's one more wrinkle here
which might be sort of

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.615
eerily reminiscent of one of the
issue I posed for you when

00:13:15.615 --> 00:13:19.670
I asked about whether we could
just keep on doing glycolysis.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.240
I can't just let
the system run.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.800
I forgot about something
so far.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.630
Over here, this guy
lost an electron.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.990
It can't get it back because the
electrons went over there.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.720
They have to come
from somewhere.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.170
Well, the energetics of the
system now are such that it

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.515
can get electrons from water.

00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:48.840
And what's left over when you
take the electrons from water?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.040
We have half of an
oxygen molecule.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.120
So here's the class.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.430
It's a waste product, if you
will, from this very efficient

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.120
noncyclic photophosphorylation
system, but

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.880
it's molecular oxygen.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.020
And it was when this system
developed that we started to

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.810
have oxygen appear
in this world.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:25.260
The organelle that carries out
photosynthesis, actually, the

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.940
first organisms that learned
how to do this is called

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.060
cyanobacteria, which they
sometimes sort of rather

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.600
incorrectly call blue-green
algae

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.650
because they're bacteria.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.710
But you see cyanobacteria
all the time.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.620
And similarly to what happened
with the mitochondria, there's

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.150
no abundant evidence that the
way photosynthesis happens in

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:56.700
plants is a cyanobacterium got
trapped somehow inside a early

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.280
plant cell, and is now
a permanent part

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.550
of the plant cell.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.800
And it's called a chloroplast.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.160
So it's derived from
a bacterium.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.400
If you see plants are green.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:20.430
If you can look in and see the
chloroplast inside, this shows

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.920
the chloroplast coming in.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.870
And here's their basic
structure.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.360
They too have a double
membrane.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.100
They have an outer membrane.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.360
They have an inner membrane.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.910
They have a part that's called
the stroma, and that's

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:44.380
essentially, like the cytoplasm
of a normal cell.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.130
And they have something in
here called a lumen.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.360
It's a space, and the membrane
that bounds it is a special

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.040
membrane called a thylakoid
membrane.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.070
And that gradient is established
by pumping an

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:17.060
electron from the stroma, which
I called out, into the

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.190
lumen, which I called in.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.540
Again, the point is this cell
managed to establish a proton

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.090
gradient, and it's able to make
the chloroplast, able to

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.230
establish a protein gradient,
and make ATP.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.510
And there's a transmission
micrograph of a chloroplast.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.900
You can see the thylakoid
membranes inside.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.830
It's not too hard to imagine
that that was, in fact, a

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.660
cyanobacterium that
got in there.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.980
And there's quite a bit of
additional evidence that

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.230
supports that.
