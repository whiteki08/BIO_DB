00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.710
PROFESSOR: Hi, my name is
Nicole and welcome to

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.170
recitation.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.460
Today we are going to go over
the practice problem for the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.790
nucleic acids, carbohydrates,
and lipids section of the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.710
biochemistry module.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.940
First, if you haven't had
a chance to look at this

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.860
problem, please go back and look
at it and then come back

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.055
to recitation and we'll
go over it together.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.040
Welcome back.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.430
To start this problem, we are
going to go through parts A

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.680
through D and then we'll take
a break and come back and do

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.760
parts E and F.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.400
So, this problem asks us about
the molecule shown here.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.050
First, we are asked to
name this molecule.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.590
By looking at this molecule,
it's really easy to figure out

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.610
what it is.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.150
All you have to do is notice
the fatty acid tail and the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.550
phosphate head.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.955
If you remember from lecture,
this should tell you that it

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.205
is a phospholipid.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
Next, we are asked where we find
these molecules in living

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.140
cells and what the function
of these molecules is.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.110
So if you remember from lecture,
we are told that we

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.685
find these molecules
in cell membranes.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.970
We learned that they are an
integral part of cell

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.530
membranes and their function is
to control the permeability

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.120
of the cell, which is a very
important function.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.260
Their structure allows them to
keep out polar molecules and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.610
let in nonpolar molecules so
they can allow the cell to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.320
have a high solute concentration
on the inside as

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.580
compared to the outside.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.840
So their critical function is to
form a permeability barrier

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.090
on the cell.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.230
So now that we understand what
the function of these

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.500
molecules is, this question asks
us what would happen if

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.770
we dropped these molecules
into a glass of water.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.000
So sometimes these molecules
are drawn like this, with a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.230
circle as the phosphate
head and two squiggly

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.140
lines as the tail.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.790
So if we dropped these in
water, we can get three

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.280
possibilities.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.930
Either they can form a micelle,
which is drawn with

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.920
all of the heads towards the
outside, facing the water

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.050
molecules and the tails all
hidden on the inside.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.120
Or, it can form a liposome,
which is two layers with a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.600
very tight layer of
phospholipids on the inside

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.240
and a larger layer of
phospholipids on the outside

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.390
with the tails facing inwards
and the heads facing outwards

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.640
towards the water.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.220
And there is also water
in the middle as well

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.990
facing these nonpolar--

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.440
I mean, these polar heads.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.530
The third structure they
can form is a bilayer.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.050
This is a structure that is
found that makes cell

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.500
membranes, is this phospholipid
bilayer.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.115
So this is actually a much
larger structure--

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.140
I've only drawn part
of it here--

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.490
and this is where you have water
on both sides of it.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:28.180
So you have water molecules out
here and on the inside of

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.080
the bilayer.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.330
So those are the three
molecules that--

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.460
three structures that this
molecule will form when you

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.910
drop it into water.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.770
Now the most important part of
this problem is asking why do

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.950
these molecules form these
structures when

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.150
dropped into water.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.350
And we can find the answer to
this very easily in just

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.370
looking at the properties
of phospholipids and the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.270
properties of water.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.190
If you look at a phospholipid,
you'll see that the head, the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.510
phosphate head, is negatively
charged, so that means that

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:15.620
it's polar, whereas the tail is
a fatty acid, and we have

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.630
learned that that means
that it is nonpolar,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.080
because it has no charge.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.880
And if you look at
water, water is a

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.500
polar molecule as well.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.110
It has two polar bonds
to hydrogen.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.890
And the reason that they form
these structures is because

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.960
the polar heads of the
phospholipids want to interact

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.530
with polar water and the
nonpolar tails of the

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.610
phospholipids do not want to
interact with the polar water.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.040
So they have to find the
confirmations in which the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.760
tails are hidden from
water and the heads

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.170
are exposed to water.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.140
So now that we understand why
phospholipids form these

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.660
structures, we're going to take
a break and come back to

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.950
the second part of
the problem.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.630
Welcome back.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.400
Now we are going to solve parts
E and F of this problem.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.720
Part E asks us to draw another
molecule that contains

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.180
phosphate that is essential
to biological systems.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.400
Right off, you should be
thinking about nucleic acids.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.570
I have written an example of
a nucleic acid up here.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.550
This, as you can see by the A in
the base position, is ATP.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.880
And you can see where phosphate
is essential as the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.740
triphosphate portion of ATP.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.560
The next part of the question
asks us what is the function

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.800
of these type of molecules?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.640
So the molecule that I chose
to draw, ATP, is very

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.120
interesting because it has
multiple functions.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.720
It serves as a building block of
RNA through oligomerization

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.120
through this bond by
adding multiple

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.505
nucleic acids together.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.010
It also serves as an energy
source for the cell, the

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:32.980
energy source for the cell,
through breaking of this bond,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.560
which is an exergonic reaction
and releases energy and allows

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.160
a lot of the processes in the
cell that wouldn't normally be

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.530
able to occur to occur.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.010
So I'm going to put as a
function of this molecule as

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:57.240
both energy and RNA.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.690
So now that we understand the
properties of phospholipids

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.070
and we've been able to
identify another very

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.310
important molecule that contains
phosphate, we can

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.090
move on to the rest of the
biochemistry section.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.560
In this problem, we have learned
about the properties

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.600
of phospholipids as well as the
importance of phosphate in

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.510
nucleic acids.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.050
I hope you've enjoyed watching
this video and I hope to see

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.300
you next time.
