1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,770
PROFESSOR: Now having cut
DNA, we then need to

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,020
do something else.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,245
What's the next thing
we have to do?

4
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:19,710
AUDIENCE: Paste it.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,290
PROFESSOR: Paste it right.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,601
Oh, I put past.

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,840
It should be paste.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,890
There we go.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,680
We should paste it.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,780
So, how are we going
to paste our DNA?

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,960
So let's take some human DNA.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,360
We'll take your human DNA.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,490
We'll add EcoR1 to it.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,870
And your human DNA is going to
get cut up in lots of little

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,680
pieces of length about 4,000.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,420
And I'm writing R1 at the ends
because these pieces of DNA

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,230
have EcoR1 sites.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,790
Now, I can take that human DNA
and I can combine it with

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,040
other pieces of DNA.

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,710
Here's a piece of DNA.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,500
Remember it had this
overhang like that.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,410
T-T-A-A was this piece
here of human DNA.

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,510
And I could take another piece
of DNA that matched it a

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:41,100
A-A-T-T.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,290
And it doesn't have
to be human.

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,080
It could be something else.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,330
It could be zebra.

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,320
Some human DNA, some zebra DNA,
and by that base pairing

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,732
of those four bases, they'll
sort of stick.

30
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:58,580
It's not that strong.

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,536
It's four bases of base pairing,
but they'll stick.

32
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:05,100
Now I'd like to glue
them together.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,889
What's the word for attaching
together DNA strands?

34
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,500
We talked about it--

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,010
Ligate, we want to ligate
them together.

36
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,750
So now we go back to our MIT
engineers and say, please

37
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,150
invent me a protein that's
able to ligate

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,850
together pieces of DNA.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,720
But actually, who invented
it first?

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,220
Bacteria invented it first.

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,260
And it's called?

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,620
Ligase.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,110
So all we have to do
is add ligase.

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,450
So it was kind of useful
to know how

45
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,180
DNA replication worked.

46
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,110
We add ligase.

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,260
And what does ligase
do for a living?

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,230
For a living, ligase is paid to
go around and find pieces

49
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,890
of DNA that have nicks and seal
them back up by repairing

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,860
the sugar phosphate
backbone of DNA.

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,700
And again, ancient molecular
biologists would prove their

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,090
mettle by purifying ligase and
using it in their reactions.

53
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,480
And today, where do
we get ligase?

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,100
It's in the catalog.

55
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,760
Ligase is in the catalog,
reasonably cheap.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:24,770
So, when we add ligase we could
now get a hybrid piece

57
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,310
of DNA that was half human
and half zebra.

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,950
I got to say, this freaks
some people out.

59
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,610
This doesn't freak me out
because it's just a sequence

60
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,410
of nucleotides.

61
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,920
If I give you a sequence of
nucleotides, to my mind,

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,990
there's nothing human
or zebra about it.

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,390
It's a chemical.

64
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,210
And you can make bonds between
chemicals and all that.

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,080
So, we now pasted our
DNA using ligase.

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,070
Ligase from the catalog.

67
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,550
Now the question is, what are we
going to paste our DNA to?

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,185
What do we paste our DNA to?

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,910
We're going to paste our DNA to
a fascinating other piece

70
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:29,224
of DNA like this.

71
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:33,400
I'll make that a little
bigger here.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,580
That has an EcoR1 site,
has an EcoR1 site.

73
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:48,680
And we're going to take our
human DNA and paste it in such

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,890
a way that it makes a circle.

75
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,900
This piece of DNA is a vector.

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,470
Vector means it travels
around.

77
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,700
It carries things with it.

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:11,840
So I want this vector to be
able to replicate if I

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,990
transfer it to E Coli.

80
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,810
So that's the trick.

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,250
I would like to be able to
attachment my human DNA to

82
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,720
this vector DNA, and when I
transfer it to E coli, have

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,450
this thing be able to grow.

84
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,460
So that means we need to invent
a piece of DNA, a

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,010
vector, that is capable
of causing E. coli

86
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,450
to replicate itself.

87
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,510
It's got to have all the
instructions to cause E. coli

88
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,280
to replicate this
piece of DNA.

89
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,920
So this is another amazing
bit of engineering.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,650
How do we invent just the right
sequence of letters that

91
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,990
would allow E. coli to
replicate this thing?

92
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,750
AUDIENCE: Already
been invented.

93
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,630
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

94
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,030
AUDIENCE: It's already been
invented by E. coli.

95
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,490
PROFESSOR: It's already
been invented by E.

96
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,610
coli, hasn't it?

97
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,790
So you're getting the theme
here, is that we don't

98
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,010
actually do anything in
molecular biology.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,830
Now look, in fairness, life's
had 3.5 billion years.

100
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,340
We've been at this a decade
or two, on the

101
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,790
whole, maybe three.

102
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,080
On the whole, life's had
a lot more time to

103
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,090
work this stuff out.

104
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,360
And usually the best solution
is to look in nature to see

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,420
where nature has already
done it for you.

106
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,670
So E. coli, it turns out,
replicates its own chromosome.

107
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,010
You could use the machinery
from its own chromosome.

108
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,130
But it turns out even
better than that.

109
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,230
E. coli has the following.

110
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,570
Here's its big chromosome, four
million letters of E.

111
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,790
coli chromosome.

112
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,100
E. Coli also has within
it little circles

113
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,080
of DNA called plasmids.

114
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,370
These little circles
of DNA are able to

115
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,020
autonomously replicate.

116
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,330
They can copy themselves.

117
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,180
Or that is to say, E.
coli copies them.

118
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,310
These little plasmids have the
full replication instructions

119
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,480
encoded in them.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,450
Now why does E. coli have
these plasmids?

121
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,530
What's in these plasmids?

122
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,220
What's going on?

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,050
Well let's blow up one
of these plasmids.

124
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,370
It's a big circle.

125
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,960
And it has an instruction here,
a sequence, called an

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:51,195
origin of replication - or
amongst friends, just ORI.

127
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,480
It's called ORI.

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,850
You'll find on maps, origin
of replication.

129
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,820
That sequence alone is enough to
cause E. coli to open it up

130
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,330
and start doing its DNA
replication from the origin.

131
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,520
But what tells you why this is
so important is that these

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,160
plasmids typically have
one or two genes.

133
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,150
And the one or two genes that
they typically have are genes

134
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:29,330
that encode a protein that gives
them resistance to an

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,424
antibiotic, like say,
penicillin.

136
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,200
There could be a gene that
gives you penicillin

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,450
resistance.

138
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,070
That's kind of cool.

139
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,140
E. coli, or other bacteria--

140
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,230
not E. coli necessarily
for penicillin--

141
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,520
carry around often
little circles.

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,500
And these little circles encode
genes that give them

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,540
resistance to streptomycin,
penicillin, ampicillin, all

144
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,790
sorts of things.

145
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,360
This allows it to grow, even if
you're taking penicillin.

146
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,840
Now, that's pretty clever.

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,090
How did E. Coli come up?

148
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,980
How is it so smart to know to
have come up with a gene able

149
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,670
to break down penicillin, given
that we've only been

150
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,620
using penicillin since
the 1940s?

151
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,510
Pretty fast for E. coli to have
figured out how to do

152
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,760
that, isn't it?

153
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,900
Oh yeah, who invented
penicillin?

154
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,440
Nature invented penicillin.

155
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,780
It's produced by fungi.

156
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,250
Fungi have been fighting E.
Coli with penicillin for

157
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,070
millions of years.

158
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,185
E. coli didn't invent
it for us.

159
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:58,690
E. Coli invented it because it's
in a war down there at

160
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,460
the single cell level
with fungi.

161
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,850
Fungi make antibi--

162
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,730
You see, we think
we're so cool.

163
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,160
We make antibiotics.

164
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,500
Well we've been making
antibiotics

165
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,640
only since the 1940s.

166
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,350
Nature's been making antibiotics
forever.

167
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,270
Just like the viruses are
infecting E. coli and E. coli

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,770
needs an immune system
against the viruses.

169
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,150
Well the fungi are throwing
antibiotics at the bacteria

170
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,620
and it needs a defense
mechanism.

171
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,570
And the defense mechanism are
these genes that can break

172
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,140
down those antibiotics.

173
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,040
And as usual, we just
come along and we

174
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,860
say, oh look at that.

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,020
It's already been invented.

176
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,610
Kind of cool.

177
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,870
We'll use that one too.

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,370
Now why are these on these
little circles?

179
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,750
They're on the little circles
because when this bacteria has

180
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,420
lived a long and happy life and
it dies and it spews its

181
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:56,540
guts out, neighboring bacteria
suck up the DNA.

182
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,670
Sounds a little cannibalistic
or something.

183
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,280
But that's how it
is down there at

184
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,880
the single cell level.

185
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,420
The neighboring bacteria
will suck up DNA.

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,980
And why is that cool?

187
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,310
It's cool because they can
acquire these resistances.

188
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,250
That's pretty impressive.

189
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,670
They can acquire
the resistance.

190
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,890
And in fact, it even works
across species.

191
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,490
That's why you don't put it
on the chromosome here.

192
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,140
Because E. coli could pick it up
from another species that's

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,160
not E. coli, but related
enough that it

194
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
can use that plasmid.

195
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,640
And you can transfer antibiotic
resistance across

196
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,410
many species of bacteria.

197
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,520
So the bacteria like to suck up
DNA and see what they find.

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,560
Pretty cool.

199
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,070
By the way, this is also why
indiscriminate use of

200
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,560
antibiotics, for example, in
animal feed, or when you were

201
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,670
given antibiotics by the MIT
health service and are told to

202
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,690
take them for two weeks and you
take them for five days,

203
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,260
you're not doing anything
very good.

204
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,980
You're just selecting for
bacteria that can grow in the

205
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,210
presence of antibiotics and
selecting for multidrug

206
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,470
resistance in the spread
of antibiotics.

207
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,410
We have to be pretty careful.

208
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,560
Because all these mechanisms
of swapping antibiotic

209
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,460
resistance are pretty
impressive tricks.

210
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,320
Anyway, so these things exist.

211
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,570
And originally, molecular
biologists

212
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,050
discovered these plasmids.

213
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,680
They purified these plasmids.

214
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,460
And the deal was this,
they cut the

215
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,620
plasmid with EcoR1, ideally.

216
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,980
So I'm going to put this
up here, vectors.

217
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,340
They cut the plasmid
with EcoR1.

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,060
They ligate human DNA into it.

219
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,640
And they get these circles.

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
And there you go.

221
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,200
Now today, obviously, if I
wanted to do this experiment,

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,160
would I purify the
plasmid myself?

223
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,540
No.

224
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,100
Where would I get the
plasmid from?

225
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,920
AUDIENCE: Catalog.

226
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,980
PROFESSOR: It's in
the catalog.

227
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,660
There's a whole section
a plasmids here.

228
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,240
They have vectors
of all sorts.

229
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,310
So you get it from
the catalog.

230
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,560
All right.
