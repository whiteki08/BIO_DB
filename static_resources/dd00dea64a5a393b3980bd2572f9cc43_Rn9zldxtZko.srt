PROFESSOR: Hi.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,670
In this clip, we're going to
discuss the numbering and

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,730
labeling conventions of
RNA and of protein.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,270
Here we have a nucleoside
triphosphate or NTP.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,110
This NTP is numbered
on each carbon.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,180
And we're going to start here
to the right of this oxygen

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,580
and label one prime and proceed
two prime, three

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,820
prime, four prime, and this
last, five prime carbon.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,560
This means that when we
polymerize two or more of

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,630
these NTP's to get an RNA chain,
it becomes apparent why

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,770
one end is labeled five prime
and the other end is labeled

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,160
three prime.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,200
On this end, the extending atom
is the five prime carbon.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,269
And on this side, the other end,
the extending atom is the

15
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,040
three prime carbon attached
to this oxygen.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,120
This three prime carbon is where
you would attach another

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,340
NTP if you would wish to
extend this chain.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,070
And so we label the ends of RNA
five prime to three prime.

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,600
And RNA is always polymerized in
the five prime to the three

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,850
prime direction.

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,150
Now with our amino acid, we
label this end, which is our

22
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,690
amino terminus, as N and this
end which is our carboxy

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:43,740
terminus as C. As before, when
we polymerize three amino

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,880
acids into this short protein
chain, I'm going to label this

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,660
end which has a protruding amino
terminus as N and this

26
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,370
end which has a protruding
carboxy terminus as C.

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,260
So that's how the conventions
are in science to label and

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,540
number amino acids
and proteins.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,790
Thanks for watching.
