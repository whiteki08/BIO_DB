PROFESSOR: Hello, and welcome
to another help session on

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,270
recombinant DNA.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,960
Today we're going to
discuss genomic

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,290
libraries and cDNA libraries.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,100
So what is a genomic library?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,340
Well, with most organisms
the genome is really too

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,080
large to deal with.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,260
It's too large to work
with or to examine.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,870
So oftentimes it's more useful
to cut it down into smaller

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,600
pieces that you can
then examine.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,170
How do we make a genomic
library?

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, we start off with
our cell of interest.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,750
And the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,940
isolate all the DNA
from the cell.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,510
Once we have the DNA, we're
going to use restriction

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,500
enzymes to cut it into
smaller sections.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,650
Now, we have to be very careful
when we choose which

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,720
restriction enzyme
we want to use.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,240
We want to use an enzyme that
has enough restriction sites

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,940
in the genome so that we'll get
small enough pieces to put

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,580
in the vector, but not
so small that all the

22
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,960
genes get cut up.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,250
Usually what we we'll use for
the vector is a plasmid.

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,530
A plasmid is a very standard
and easy way to get foreign

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,030
DNA into a bacteria.

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,440
So we're going to cut up our DNA
and the plasmid with our

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,900
restriction enzyme.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,390
Sometimes we might want to
even make two different

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,830
libraries using two different
restriction enzymes so that

30
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,125
we'll have the cuts in
different places.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,510
Once we have our cut up DNA and
our plasmids, now we need

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,190
to ligate them together
using DNA ligase.

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,180
Once the cDNA is pasted into the
plasmid, now we're ready

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,790
to actually transform
them into bacteria.

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,620
It's very easy to transform
plasmids into bacteria.

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,990
There are multiple different
ways to do it.

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,110
One common one is to use heat
shock, whereby you heat the

38
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,150
bacteria up and then cool it
down rapidly, which causes

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,910
little holes to open
up that allows the

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,190
plasmids to be taken up.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,380
What we end up with are
thousands of different

42
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,280
bacteria cells, all with
different sections of the DNA.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,170
So combined, all these different
sections form the

44
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,440
genome, the original genome that
we have, but they're in

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,600
much smaller sections.

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,430
They're much easier
to work with.

47
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,350
And this combination of all
these different cells forms

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,590
our genomic library.

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,470
So that's one type of library.

50
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,320
Another type of library
is a cDNA library.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,690
So the way that the cDNA library
is different from a

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,690
genomic library is that while
the genomic library

53
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,090
encompasses the entire genome of
the cell, the cDNA library

54
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,860
just looks at what genes are
being expressed in the cell.

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,870
So let's go over how we would
make a cDNA library.

56
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,870
What we're going to start off
with is we're going to start

57
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,160
off by isolating the mRNA.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,760
So the mRNA, clearly, is
the RNA that's being

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,690
expressed in the cell.

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,690
This is what's ultimately-- the
proteins are going to be

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,021
produced by the cell.

62
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,530
We're then going to use reverse
transcription to

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,670
create the DNA version
of the RNA.

64
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,750
This is what we're referring
to, again, as the cDNA.

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,700
Once we have the cDNA, we then
need to add restriction sites

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,643
to the ends of them.

67
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:12,490
Remember, before we were just
able to use innate restriction

68
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,530
sites in the genomes.

69
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,720
But for the cDNA library,
we really want to

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,620
keep the cDNA intact.

71
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,050
We don't want to cut it up.

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,630
So we just want to add
restriction sites to the ends

73
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,440
of the cDNA.

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,190
Then we can treat the cDNA
and the plasmids

75
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,550
with restriction enzymes.

76
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,500
Once again, once they've been
cut up we can use DNA ligase

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,850
to combine the cut up plasmids
and the cut up cDNA to the

78
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,930
complete plasmid plus cDNA.

79
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,320
And finally, once again, we can
transform our bacteria,

80
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,410
and then the combination of
all these cells, all with

81
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,300
different types of cDNA,
form our cDNA library.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,240
And cDNA libraries are very
useful if you want to compare

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,780
the difference in protein
expressions between two

84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,010
different cells.

85
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,780
Thank you very much.

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,880

session for recombinant DNA.
