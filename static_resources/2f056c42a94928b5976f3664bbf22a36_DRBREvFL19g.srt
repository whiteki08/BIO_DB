1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,480
ERIC LANDER: And so the issue
became how does DNA

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,875
replication work.

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,650
And so I'm about
to go into it.

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,130
Now, I'm going to note we're
going to be starting this DNA

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:35,790
goes to RNA, goes to protein,
and DNA goes to itself.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,100
DNA is replicated.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,450
It makes RNA.

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,710
The RNA is used to
make protein.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,780
This will be what
we'll be talking

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700
about today and tomorrow.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,640
So the first step of that
is, how does DNA give

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,370
rise to more DNA?

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,330
Well, how do you
find an enzyme?

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,580
How do you do biochemistry?

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,540
What do you do?

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,890
AUDIENCE: Assays.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,350
ERIC LANDER: Assay.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,730
So you've got to grind
up the cell.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,730
I got to choose a cell in which
I'm likely to find an

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,830
enzyme, grind it up, break it
up into different fractions,

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,200
and test each fraction.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,930
That's all biochemists
do, right?

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,950
So what cell might have the
enzyme we're looking for?

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,675
What cells might be
able to copy DNA?

25
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:20,400
How about all cells?

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,570
So let's use a simple cell.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,180
What's a simple cell?

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,330
Let's use bacteria.

29
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,000
So we'll take some bacteria,
we'll grow it up,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,920
we'll grind it up.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,130
We'll fractionate it into
different fractions, and we'll

32
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,810
see if one of those fractions
has the ability to copy DNA.

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,150
If we're going to run
an assay, we have

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,880
to give it a substrate.

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,610
What substrate would you
like to give it?

36
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,760
What do you think it needs?

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,380
ERIC LANDER: It better have
some free nucleotides

39
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,980
otherwise, how are we
going to make DNA.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,010
What else?

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,490
Are you going to ask it to
make DNA all by itself?

42
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,110
We want something that can copy
one of the strands of a

43
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,310
double helix.

44
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,140
So what should we give it?

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,150
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

47
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,020
AUDIENCE: Half a helix.

48
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,850
ERIC LANDER: Half a helix.

49
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,480
A strand of DNA, the strand
to be used as a template.

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,965
So let's give it a
template strand.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,860
So we'll take a template
strand of DNA.

52
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,390
There's my template of DNA.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,810
Let's actually give it a little

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,980
sequence actually, here.

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:34,330
Let's say A phosphate, T
phosphate, G phosphate, C

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,480
phosphate, A phosphate, T
phosphate, T phosphate, A

57
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,460
phosphate, G phosphate,
G phosphate.

58
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,810
I'm going to not write the
phosphates too much longer,

59
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,760
guys, but anyway C phosphate,
C phosphate, T

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,060
phosphate, like that.

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,410
Pretty soon, in fact, almost
immediately, I'm going to

62
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,820
start dropping the phosphates
in here.

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,930
But that's the way it goes.

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,610
All right.

65
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,860
That's a template.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,845
We need floating around in the
solution some trinucleotides.

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:33,230
We have some nucleotides
floating around.

68
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,330
And now will this enzyme work?

69
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,540
We would try different fractions
and see if it's able

70
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,940
to just install the right
letters in the right place.

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,620
Now, it turned out it needed one
more thing, and the person

72
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,370
who discovered this, Arthur
Kornberg, thought of it.

73
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,760
It needed a head start.

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,010
It needed a primer.

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,690
So the primer goes let's say,
phosphate T, phosphate A,

76
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:16,670
phosphate C, phosphate G,
phosphate T, phosphate A,

77
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,399
let's say like that.

78
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,950
So this is the five
prime end of DNA.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,490
Remember the phosphate is
hanging off the five prime

80
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,940
carbon, right?

81
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,400
What's look at the other end.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,640
The other end ends in the
hydroxyl on the three prime

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,790
end of the ribose.

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,010
Since this is anti-parallel,
this strand is going five

85
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,090
prime phosphate to three
prime hydroxyl.

86
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,540
You're going to need to know
five prime and three prime.

87
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,470
So I'm doing this so you
get used to five

88
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,880
prime and three prime.

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,580
There you go.

90
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,460
If you're handed a primer to get
a head start, and you're

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,460
handed a template, and you hand
it some nucleotides, you

92
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,800
then assay different fractions
exactly as you suggested and

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,300
we see is one of them capable
of extending this strand by

94
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,640
putting in an A, putting in a T,
putting in a C, putting in

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,320
a C, putting in a C, putting
in a G. That's the assay.

96
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:29,450
And Arthur Kornberg discovered
an enzyme that could do this.

97
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,000
And the biochemists went nuts.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,940
They thought, wow.

99
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,520
This is so cool.

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,770
Kornberg is able to discover
an enzyme that

101
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,220
can accomplish this.

102
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,470
The enzyme polymerizes DNA.

103
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,754
Coincidentally, what is
the enzyme called?

104
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:47,660
AUDIENCE: DNA polymerase.

105
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,320
ERIC LANDER: DNA polymerase.

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,130
Accidentally, has a nice name.

107
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,310
Good.

108
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,050
DNA polymerase.

109
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,190
Excellent.

110
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,640
Now, notice what it does.

111
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,130
It takes this triphosphate, puts
it in here, and it joins

112
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,140
it into a sugar phosphate
chain.

113
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,205
Where does it get the energy
for that synthesis?

114
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,600
Hydrolysis of the triphosphates,
right?

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
It's the hydrolysis of
the triphosphate.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
That's the energy.

117
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,030
What direction is the synthesis
proceeding?

118
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,120
Starts here at the five prime
end, and it moves adding on to

119
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,400
the three prime end.

120
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,880
So it's five prime to three
prime direction.

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,540
That's the direction it moves.

122
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,720
It adds to the three
prime end.

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,370
It adds to the free
nucleotides to

124
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,620
the three prime end.

125
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,025
Why not do it the other way?

126
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:55,140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

127
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,170
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

128
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,370
AUDIENCE: Phosphates.

129
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,286
ERIC LANDER: Can't hear you.

130
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:58,700
Shout loud.

131
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,586
AUDIENCE: Phosphates.

132
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,000
ERIC LANDER: Phosphates, yes.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,075
You see, suppose we were
going the other way.

134
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,540
Suppose the primer
was this way.

135
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,600
Where would as we added each
base, the triphosphate would

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,590
be on the strands, right?

137
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:24,150
And we'd be adding to the
three prime end here.

138
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,320
That means the energy supplied
by the triphosphate would be

139
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,240
on the growing strands rather
than in the free nucleotides.

140
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,160
Why would it be a terrible idea
to put your energy source

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,729
on the growing strand?

142
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,094
MIKE: [INAUDIBLE].

143
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,280
ERIC LANDER: Well Mike, you
know, those triphosphate bonds

144
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,040
are pretty unstable.

145
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,320
They hydrolyzed by themselves
at some frequency.

146
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,550
If you're a free nucleotide
and the triphosphate

147
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,010
hydrolyzes, big deal.

148
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,900
That free nucleotide floating
around loses its triphosphate.

149
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,960
But what if I'm the growing
strand, and I lose my

150
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,115
triphosphate?

151
00:07:59,115 --> 00:07:59,720
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
ERIC LANDER: Exactly.

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,540
AUDIENCE: There goes
your chain.

154
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,470
ERIC LANDER: There
goes my chain.

155
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,530
So you know, life's
not stupid.

156
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,930
It doesn't do it that way.

157
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,870
It does it this way.

158
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,050
No one has ever found a
polymerase that goes this way.

159
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,230
They find them all going that
way for just that reason.

160
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,660
Exactly.

161
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,100
Bingo.

162
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,210
That was why life evolved it
that way, because you want

163
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,190
your triphosphates, those
hydrolyzable triphosphates to

164
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,320
be floating around freely
rather than investing.

165
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,270
Now just think about that.

166
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,140
It's a kind of cool thing.

167
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,670
It doesn't matter.

168
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,910
Your book doesn't
talk about it.

169
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,080
But to me, it helps me remember
which way it's going

170
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,370
and how it is, and it's
kind of interesting.

171
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,110
Any way.

172
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,710
All right.

173
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,440
So Kornberg wins the Nobel
Prize for this.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,870
Good stuff.

175
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,920
It's very deserved, but you
know, there's some questions.

176
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,340
Where does the primer
come from in life?

177
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,270
See, Kornberg gave this
test tube a primer.

178
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,520
But suppose I'm replicating
some DNA.

179
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,770
So let's suppose I have a double
strand of DNA, and I'm

180
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,460
just going to open it up here,
five prime to three prime,

181
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,280
five prime to three prime.

182
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,769
I need to get like
a primer here.

183
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,830
Then the primer can be extended
by polymerase.

184
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,560
Well, where's the primer
come from?

185
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,850
It turns out there is an enzyme
specially devoted to

186
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,440
making those primers.

187
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,080
Kornberg didn't know it,
but there's an enzyme.

188
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,420
And by coincidence, it
is called primase.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,240
Exactly.

190
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,290
Primase makes the primer.

191
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,025
So you need a primer here, and
the primer is made by primase.

192
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:07,810
Once primase makes a primer,
polymerase can chug along and

193
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,340
do it just fine.

194
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,860
Let's check out the
other strand.

195
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,390
Primer here, polymerase
chugs along.

196
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,210
But now as this double
helix opens up, what

197
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,460
happens over here?

198
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,150
The synthesis going this way.

199
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,670
So what do I have to do here?

200
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,318
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

201
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,232
ERIC LANDER: Another primer.

202
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,482
Need another primer.

203
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,510
Then as it opens up more,
what do I need?

204
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,530
AUDIENCE: Another primer.

205
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,780
ERIC LANDER: Another primer.

206
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,100
So the two strands are
experiencing very different

207
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,450
kind of replication.

208
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,420
In one place, one primer in the
five prime to three prime

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,840
direction is enough
to keep going.

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,830
In the other strand, as it keeps
opening up, you gotta

211
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,510
keep making primers.

212
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,550
You have all these little
fragments there.

213
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,520
Now, those little fragments were
discovered by Okazaki,

214
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,960
and they are called
Okazaki fragments.

215
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,260
Again, I just mention
these things.

216
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,570
They are known to molecular
biologists.

217
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,900
But these little guys are
Okazaki fragments, and they

218
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,480
tell you that you're on
the right track here.

219
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,280
This is indeed how
it's working.

220
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,010
You can see those little
fragments there.

221
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,260
But now, what's the problem with
the Okazaki fragments?

222
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,970
They're not connected, right?

223
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,400
The primase makes a primer.

224
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,010
The polymerase copies the DNA,
it bumps into the next primer,

225
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,690
but you've got to
connect them.

226
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,420
So that's a problem.

227
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,250
That's a real problem.

228
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,500
I'll redraw that here.

229
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,160
Here was my primer.

230
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,710
I got a new primer over here.

231
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,680
I got a new primer over here.

232
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,380
Right there.

233
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,120
Right there.

234
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,340
They're not contiguous
connected.

235
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,820
The word we use for connecting
two pieces of DNA, which is a

236
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,700
standard English word not used
that often is to ligate two

237
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,060
things together.

238
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,960
Ligature, for example,
in music.

239
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,460
You ligate things together.

240
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,650
How do you think the cell deals
with ligating these

241
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,230
things together?

242
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,315
An enzyme called--

243
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,110
AUDIENCE: Ligase.

244
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,390
ERIC LANDER: Exactly.

245
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,340
So ligase does the ligation.

246
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,070
Ligase ligates.

247
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,950
It is so lucky that these
words turn out to have

248
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,780
accidentally made sense.

249
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,400
It's really cool.

250
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,950
So ligase ligates.

251
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,000
Now, I'll tell you a factoid,
but don't worry

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,820
about it too much.

253
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,360
Primase actually doesn't
make DNA.

254
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,540
We haven't gotten there
yet, but it turns out

255
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,350
primase makes RNA.

256
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,450
Turns out to be easier
to start an RNA

257
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,740
than a DNA from scratch.

258
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,710
Cell doesn't like to start
DNA from scratch.

259
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,650
It likes to start RNA from
scratch as we'll get to a

260
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,870
moment with transcription.

261
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,010
So as a factoid, I'll mention
to you that those little

262
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,340
primers are actually RNA
primers, and what happens is

263
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,800
they get extended into DNA, and
they bump into and kind of

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,070
displace the previous RNA, so
it's slightly more complicated

265
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,890
than I told you.

266
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,270
You're welcome to forget that.

267
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,290
If you would like to believe
that primase is actually

268
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,550
making little segments of
DNA, it'll be just fine.

269
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,460
But in fact, it doesn't
actually.

270
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,990
It's making little segments of
RNA so there's a whole other

271
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,070
machinery that has to
deal with that.

272
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,810
But the basic concept five prime
to three prime, little

273
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,765
primers, getting extended,
getting ligated, that's how

274
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:57,620
you make your DNA.

275
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,980
And you can check it
out, and it works.

276
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,230
All right.

277
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,770
Well, it turns out to even be
a little more complicated.

278
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,920
That was how we got the
synthesis going, but we also

279
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,030
have a little bit of a
topological problem.

280
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,120
This again, says a lot about
how people do science.

281
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,300
You gotta just like not worry
about certain things.

282
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,390
If Kornberg had said,
oh my goodness.

283
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,860
I can't give my test tube a
primer, because I don't know

284
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,550
how the cell would make a
primer, he wouldn't have made

285
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,120
any progress.

286
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,023
So he throws in the primer
and says, the cell

287
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:50,070
will figure it out.

288
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm just giving it a primer,
and I'll see what happens.

289
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,820
Now, there's another problem,
this topological problem that

290
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,300
also can make your head hurt.

291
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,050
Let me try to explain what the
topological problem is.

292
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:08,735
Suppose I have DNA like that.

293
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,580
Make that a little prettier.

294
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,110
So I have some DNA like that.

295
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,360
And maybe it goes around for
a very long distance like a

296
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,800
circle or something like that.

297
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,070
I now want to copy that DNA.

298
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,390
So I have one strand,
and I'm copying it.

299
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,650
I have this other strand,
and I'm copying it.

300
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,760
And remember, these two strands
are wrapped around,

301
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,560
and around, and around,
and around each other.

302
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,170
One is going like this.

303
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,050
One is going like that, and
there's some wrapped around.

304
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,430
And as I tug them apart to
make a new strand, to

305
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:05,560
synthesize a new strand, those
two new double helices are so

306
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,360
totally intertwined
with each other.

307
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Every turn that there was in
the double helix is now a

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,780
twist and turn connecting the
two, sort of entangling the

309
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,380
two helices.

310
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,440
So I have the two new
double helices

311
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,130
entangled with each other.

312
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,380
Why is that going
to be a problem?

313
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,070
I'm going to send these
to two daughter cells.

314
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,060
These are the two genomes for
the two daughter cells.

315
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,990
In fact in particular, if this
thing was a circle, the two

316
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,360
new circles will be totally
wrapped around each other with

317
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,650
a gazillion wraps.

318
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,130
No way they're going to
two daughter cells.

319
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,560
Now, here is where
mathematicians are very

320
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,120
useful, because it is a theorem
that if I take two

321
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,020
circles wrapped around each
other like that, there is no

322
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,750
topological deformation
possible that

323
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,590
can separate them.

324
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,359
It's like these puzzles, you
get some strings wrapped

325
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,240
around each other
separate them.

326
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,960
It's a theorem that two circles
wrapped around each

327
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,839
other like that cannot
be separated unless,

328
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,520
of course, you cheat.

329
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,352
What's cheating?

330
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,500
AUDIENCE: You cut it.

331
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,319
ERIC LANDER: You cut
it, obviously.

332
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,980
If you cut it, then you
can separate it.

333
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,670
But otherwise, it's
mathematically impossible to

334
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,430
separate them.

335
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,349
So this could concern people.

336
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,450
How could a cell do this?

337
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,867
So what does the cell do?

338
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:29,781
AUDIENCE: It cuts it.

339
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:30,820
ERIC LANDER: It cuts it.

340
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,020
It's got no choice, right?

341
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,990
It's a theorem, right?

342
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,050
Even cells can't violate
theorems.

343
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,310
So it cuts it.

344
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,440
The only way to get these things
apart is to cut it.

345
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,570
Now, what it does, is it takes
those double helices.

346
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,030
I'll represent the double
helix as a thicker

347
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,620
kind of thing now.

348
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,480
That was my double helix,
this other double helix

349
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,200
wrapped around it.

350
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,150
It's got to cut it.

351
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,840
Now, when I take two DNAs that
are wrapped around each other

352
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,720
or two DNAs that are separate,
have I done any

353
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
chemistry on them?

354
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,160
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,040
Are they chemically different?

356
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,440
They're chemically the
same molecules.

357
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,110
But they're topologically
different.

358
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,150
Topologically means
wrapped around.

359
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,160
In one case, they were
topologically entangled.

360
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,510
In the other case, they're
topologically separated from

361
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,280
each other.

362
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,030
So they're still the same
chemical bonds, the same

363
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,260
molecules, but when I separate
these two double helices now,

364
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,220
the difference between these
is that they are what are

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,860
called topoisomers.

366
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,620
They are isomers because they're
exactly the same

367
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,920
chemical formula.

368
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,940
But they're topoisomers
because they

369
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,070
have different topology.

370
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,060
They're not wrapped around
each other anymore.

371
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,900
So it turns out there is an
enzyme that just gets in there

372
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,040
and makes a double stranded
cut in one of the double

373
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,920
helices, grabs the two ends,
passes it around the other

374
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,380
side, and ligates them back
together, and keeps doing that

375
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,410
until they're disentangled.

376
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,960
Pretty clever.

377
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,445
Cut, paste, cut, paste till it
can separate those two double

378
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,520
helices from each other.

379
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,200
Remarkably, this enzyme is
called topoisomerase.

380
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,750
This job is done by
topoisomerase, actually, by

381
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,750
topoisomerase II.

382
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,820
There's a couple of different
topoisomerases, and it's

383
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,740
topoisomerase II that does this
particular job, cuts and

384
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,680
seals up that double-stranded
break.

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,080
All right.

386
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,250
It is amazing how this works.

387
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,080
Let's take another problem in
how we do DNA replication.

388
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,900
So let's deal with fidelity.

389
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,305
The fidelity, accuracy
of replication.

390
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,810
I have my strand.

391
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,730
Which direction do we go?

392
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,900
We go, for this template, five
prime to three prime.

393
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,550
This way goes five prime to
three prime, the opposite

394
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,890
direction there.

395
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,040
I now add on.

396
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,790
If this is a T, what
do I add in?

397
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

398
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:31,000
ERIC LANDER: If it's a
GCGTAAT, et cetera.

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,740
Why does the right base go in?

400
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,864
Why does the right base go in?

401
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,318
Yeah?

402
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,680
AUDIENCE: Hydrogen bonding.

403
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,030
ERIC LANDER: Hydrogen bonding.

404
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,880
It's got that these
hydrogen bonds.

405
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
AT makes two hydrogen bonds.

406
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,610
GC makes three hydrogen bonds.

407
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,500
The wrong base could
never go in.

408
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,800
Sorry.

409
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,160
In biochemistry, do you
ever say never?

410
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,400
No, we say K equilibrium.

411
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,940
We say how much more unfavored
is it for the

412
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,350
wrong base to go in?

413
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,500
It's not impossible, it's just
disfavored, because it's

414
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,260
energetically less good.

415
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,940
How much energetically
less good is it?

416
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,660
What is the delta G for putting
in the wrong base?

417
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,910
It's not infinity.

418
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,660
It turns out that there is an
equilibrium constant for

419
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:33,260
putting in the wrong base, and
that is K equilibrium is about

420
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,280
10 to the third for the right
base, 10 to the minus third

421
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,590
for the wrong base.

422
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,290
Thank goodness.

423
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,930
So only one time in 1,000 does
it put in the wrong base.

424
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,130
That's what that has
to mean, right?

425
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,870
If it's 1,000 times less favored
energetically, it

426
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:55,410
means you only make a mistake
one letter in 1,000.

427
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,700
How do you feel about that
for your own genomes?

428
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,440
Is that a level of quality
control you

429
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,500
are satisfied with?

430
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,226
AUDIENCE: No.

431
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:02,180
ERIC LANDER: No.

432
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,980
How big is a typical gene?

433
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,220
Typical gene is, in terms
of its protein coding

434
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,708
information, you guys already
know about DNA goes to RNA

435
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,090
goes to protein.

436
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,870
It's about 2,000 bases of
protein coding information.

437
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,870
That guarantees two mistakes
per cell division.

438
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,310
Not good.

439
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,320
Two mistakes per
cell division.

440
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,110
That's not OK.

441
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,340
That's two mistakes
per cell division.

442
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,030
That would be two errors per
cell division, and you have a

443
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,440
lot of cell divisions, you're
in a lot of trouble.

444
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,200
So it turns out something
more is needed.

445
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,030
Quality control is needed.

446
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:49,770
So later, it was discovered
that the enzyme DNA

447
00:22:49,770 --> 00:23:01,350
polymerase, which has a five
prime to three prime

448
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:08,200
polymerization activity also
does a second thing.

449
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,590
That same enzyme, DNA
polymerase, is also a three

450
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,590
prime to five prime
exonuclease.

451
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,120
What do you think an
exonuclease is?

452
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

453
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
ERIC LANDER: Take stuff out.

454
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,740
So it adds bases in the forward
direction, but it also

455
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,910
goes backwards and
takes bases out.

456
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,710
Isn't that dumb?

457
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,220
I thought we were trying to
synthesize, but we're also

458
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,470
unsynthesizing.

459
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,598
With some probability, it goes
backwards and takes out bases.

460
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,290
Turns out that the probability
of taking out a base backwards

461
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,860
is higher if it's
the wrong base.

462
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,540
It's proofreading as it goes
as I hope you are.

463
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,440
It's proofreading.

464
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,160
It goes backwards and takes
bases out more often.

465
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,400
Sometimes it takes out the
right bases, but it is

466
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,170
proofreading its work.

467
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,080
And more often when it's the
wrong base, it goes backwards,

468
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,920
and so you get the benefit of
a K equilibrium from the

469
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,940
original base.

470
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,420
And then there's a separate
K equilibrium for the

471
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,985
proofreading, and
that helps you.

472
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:35,260
And when you combine the
proofreading with the original

473
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,520
accuracy, now, we're down to
something like 10 to the minus

474
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,070
five or 10 to the minus
six errors per

475
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,760
base, per cell division.

476
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,935
It's only making on the order
of one error per million.

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,080
Now are we satisfied?

478
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,730
No.

479
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,370
You guys pretty hard nosed.

480
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,760
Not good enough, because you
have 50 cell divisions to make

481
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,340
more and some cells go
through many, many,

482
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,880
many more cell divisions.

483
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,400
Not acceptable.

484
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,650
But it's a start.

485
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,940
So proofreading helps.

486
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,850
So we have the fidelity
of replication.

487
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,120
Replication makes an error
at a rate of 10

488
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,650
to the minus third.

489
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:39,100
Proofreading brings you down
to 10 to the minus six, and

490
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,130
there's another process.

491
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,400
There are a set of enzymes that
go around and feel the

492
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,340
DNA double helix after it's
finished, and if you put in

493
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,620
the wrong base, the width of
the helix is not right.

494
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,550
The shape is wrong.

495
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,900
It feels for mismatches.

496
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,060
So there is a mismatch
repair system.

497
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,900
Mismatch repair comes along,
and if there was an error

498
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,120
right here, the helix bulges
out too much let's say.

499
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,400
Mismatch repair cuts, removes
some DNA, and gives the cell

500
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,510
another chance to do it again.

501
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,350
Mismatch repair gets you down
to something in the

502
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,020
neighborhood of 10 to
the minus eighth, 10

503
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,840
to the minus ninth.

504
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
Let's say for the sake
of argument, 10

505
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,390
to the minus ninth.

506
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,610
You're genome is about three
times 10 to the ninth.

507
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,100
Now making that's one or
two errors per genome,

508
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,350
that's not so bad.

509
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,240
Why do we care?

510
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,890
Why am I bothering
you with this?

511
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,810
Who cares between 10 to minus
sixth, 10 to the minus ninth?

512
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,060
Big deal.

513
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:07,450
Well, a few percent of you in
this class are heterozygous

514
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,590
for a mutation in the mismatch
repair enzymes.

515
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,730
Don't worry.

516
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,000
Your cells have the other
copy that's good.

517
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,930
But suppose one of your cells
were to lose, by mutation, the

518
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,060
good copy of the mismatch
repair enzyme?

519
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,250
And now that cell in your body
had no copies of mismatch

520
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,500
repair enzyme.

521
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,250
What do you think is going
to happen to your DNA

522
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,930
replication?

523
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,660
Instead of being one in a
billion, it would be one in a

524
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,220
million accuracy.

525
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,460
Turns out you have
an extremely high

526
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,780
risk of colon cancer.

527
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,660
There are hereditary colon
cancer syndromes that are due

528
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,800
to inherited defects in the
mismatch repair system.

529
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,380
It is not at all trivial.

530
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,900
Hereditary polyposis
coli is due to a

531
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,340
defect in this enzyme.

532
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,720
It matters.

533
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,010
You've got to get it down to
that level because otherwise,

534
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,780
you're getting mutations that
cause cancer, that is, when

535
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,430
you lose both copies, if
you lost both copies.

536
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,890
Most of your cells would be
fine, but if you'd lose the

537
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,100
other good copy, by chance,
that cell can

538
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,490
go on to cause cancer.

539
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,460
So this stuff actually
matters.

540
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,120
Finally, finally, speed.

541
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,900
Kind of fun to talk
about speed.

542
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,291
How fast does polymerase work?

543
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:43,720
It turns out that polymerase
is able to polymerize 2,000

544
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,180
nucleotides per second.

545
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,070
That's very impressive to me.

546
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,910
It zips along at 2,000
nucleotides per second,

547
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,050
installing the right base,
getting it right only 99.9% of

548
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,260
the time, proofreading as it
goes, and gets the whole thing

549
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,580
done 2,000 letters
in a second.

550
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
That is impressive
engineering.

551
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,110
That is really impressive
engineering.

552
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,170
So that's kind of how DNA
replication works well, except

553
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,420
for one thing.

554
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,790
Kornberg was a biochemist.

555
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,300
Biochemists purify things
in test tubes.

556
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:49,650
He discovered an enzyme,
Kornberg's polymerase.

557
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,420
How do we know it's the enzyme
the cell actually

558
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,070
uses to copy its DNA?

559
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,600
See, I'm a geneticist.

560
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,300
I look at Kornberg and
I say, nice job.

561
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,030
You showed me an enzyme that in
a test tube is capable of

562
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,250
polymerizing DNA.

563
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,340
How do I know that's the enzyme
that's actually doing

564
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,110
it from the cell copies
its whole genome?

565
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,858
What does a geneticist
want to see?

566
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,350
AUDIENCE: A mutant.

567
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,230
ERIC LANDER: A mutant.

568
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,000
Show me a mutant then
I'll believe.

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,330
So someone went along and took
E. colis one at a time because

570
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,400
what else could they do.

571
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,670
And for every single E. coli
they grew up from a plate,

572
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,722
they purified Kornberg's
enzyme.

573
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,680
And you know what they found?

574
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,710
They found a mutant E. coli that
lacked Kornberg's enzyme,

575
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,900
and it could replicate
its DNA just fine.

576
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,200
What does that tell us?

577
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,370
Kornberg actually had
the wrong enzyme.

578
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,270
He still deserves a Nobel Prize
for it because he got an

579
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,340
enzyme that could copy DNA.

580
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,790
It's actually not the main
enzyme that does the job.

581
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,270
Because we can make a mutant
that lacks that enzyme and it

582
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,220
can still copy the DNA, it
can't be the main enzyme.

583
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,320
Turns out what Kornberg found
was a minor polymerase that

584
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,320
was used in those mismatch
repair situations that would

585
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,190
come along and do the tidying
and clean up.

586
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,810
The main enzyme turned out to
be another enzyme, a more

587
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,390
complicated enzyme.

588
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,450
So my point about biochemistry
and genetics both having to

589
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,900
talk to each other, you only
really know something when you

590
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,940
have it from a biochemical point
of view and the genetic

591
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,000
point of view.

592
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
The two have to go together.

593
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,110
Kornberg's enzyme is
a great enzyme,

594
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,470
it's a fantastic enzyme.

595
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,410
It just happens not to be the
main enzyme, and you can only

596
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,560
know that by genetics.

597
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,360
Of course, you can only purify
it by biochemistry.

598
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,050
All right.

599
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,910
So that's DNA replication.

600
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,640
Any questions about DNA
replication before I go on?

601
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,060
Yes?

602
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

603
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,450
ERIC LANDER: Polymerase III or
polymerase II, depending on

604
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,200
the organism.

605
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,330
They're all called
polymerases.

606
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,650
They're all DNA polymerases.

607
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,470
They just get different
names and numbers.

608
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,150
Turns out most cells have
multiple polymerases and

609
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,780
Kornberg found the kind
of simpler polymerase.

610
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,980
The main replication polymerase
also called

611
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,190
polymerase but with a different
number, is a

612
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,410
different more complicated
enzyme.

613
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:33,800
Yes?

614
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,620
AUDIENCE: How does the enzyme
know which one is the right..?

615
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,520
ERIC LANDER: how does it know
which one is right?

616
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

617
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:47,080
ERIC LANDER: Because 50% of
the time you get it wrong.

618
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,530
Do you know what bacteria do?

619
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,420
What a great question.

620
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,670
How would it know which
one to get right?

621
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,400
Know what bacteria do?

622
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,780
They're very tricky.

623
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,210
They mark their DNA, don't
worry about this.

624
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,680
They mark their DNA with
methyl groups.

625
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,870
There is an enzyme that comes
along and put methyl groups at

626
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:11,640
certain positions, but that
enzyme is kind of slow.

627
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,100
So I have a methyl-marked
DNA double helix.

628
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,580
When I replicate it, the new
strand is made, and what does

629
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,610
the new strand lack?

630
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,000
AUDIENCE: Little
methyl groups.

631
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,910
ERIC LANDER: Little
methyl groups.

632
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,110
It'll get them eventually
because that slow enzyme will

633
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,050
come along and put them on, but
mismatch repair is fast.

634
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,940
So what is mismatch repair
looking for?

635
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,480
The little methyl groups that
are kind of breadcrumbs that

636
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,330
say, this was the old strand,
and this guy is the new stand.

637
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,370
It's thought of everything.

638
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,020
It's really smart.

639
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,270
Very, very smart.
