00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.450
INSTRUCTOR: Good morning.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.980
Good morning.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.630
So, anybody check The New
York Times yesterday?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.413
What did you see?

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:19.663
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.154
INSTRUCTOR: People,
what people?

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.050
AUDIENCE: I can't remember
their names.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.524
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:31.998
INSTRUCTOR: [LAUGHS]

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.248
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.750
I can't remember their names.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.870
INSTRUCTOR: Yeah, the Crick
and Watson people.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.030
INSTRUCTOR: Exactly.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.230
So, perfect timing, The New York
Times had an article in

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.570
yesterday's paper.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.130
Francis Crick's correspondence
with Maurice Wilkins during

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.430
the critical year when Crick and
Watson went down and saw

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.100
the X-ray crystallography.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.190
By the way, I made a mistake.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.650
I said that Rosalind Franklin
showed it to Crick and Watson.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.795
Actually it was Maurice Wilkins
who showed it to Crick

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:09.330
and Watson when Rosalind
Franklin was away.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
Which, was itself a slightly
complicated thing to be doing

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.670
because it was really Rosalind
Franklin's work.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.200
But in any case, there was
correspondence, some heated

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.230
correspondence that went
back between Crick

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.900
and Wilkins and others.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.020
And it was believed that the
correspondence had been lost,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.860
had been thrown out.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.690
But in fact, it turns out that
in the papers of Sydney

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.130
Brenner, another great person
of that period, Crick's

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.750
correspondence had got misfiled
in Sydney's files.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
Sydney had donated his files
to the Cold Spring Harbor

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.190
Laboratory on Long Island.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.360
And they went through the files
in the past several

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.270
months and found them.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.990
So we actually now have, as The
New York Times reported

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.340
yesterday, the letters with
Crick and Watson and Maurice

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.200
Wilkins about just that period
I was telling you about.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.150
It doesn't radically change
any of the story.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.280
But it really shows
you the attitude.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.389
And if you read the New York
Times article, you'll find all

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.550
sorts of juicy quotes about the
attitude back and forth

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.210
there, including the first model
Crick and Watson made

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.790
where they totally screwed up
because they had misunderstood

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.370
some number.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.150
Anyway, it's interesting
stuff.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.820
And the reason I bring up this
history is because science is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.340
done by real people.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920
It's a business of passion.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.130
It's a business of trying
to-- you know --

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.560
science is wonderful.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.720
It's objective in
a certain sense.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.346
And it's also about
convincing others.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:40.830
You know, a scientific result
doesn't mean anything unless

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.580
you can convince
the community.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.730
So it's an inherently human
activity to bring people's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.240
attention to things,
make things clear.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.400
Anyway, that was kind of cool.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.160
I invite you all to go look
at The Times article.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.490
You don't realize how much work
we have to go to in 7.01

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.990
to arrange these things to come
out just at the right

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.250
time during our curriculum.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.070
But we pay off The New York
Times and they do our bidding.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.530
So last time we were
talking about--

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.810
I want to briefly go back to
the Semiconservative Model,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.010
which I ended with last time,
of DNA replication, the work

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.110
of Matt Meselson and Frank
Stahl, these graduate students

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.300
at Caltech.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.680
So you remember, our DNA double
helix immediately

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.520
suggests the secret of life,
the way that you copy

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.480
information to daughter cells.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.210
Each strand is a sufficient
template for the other strand.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.830
If you just unzipped them, each
would be able to serve as

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.850
a template for replication
for the other strand.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.420
Beautiful.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.420
It's called Semiconservative
because you've conserved.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.180
You used one strand.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300
And you've made a new
strand on the other.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.950
It seems obvious, but
we can't take things

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.190
for obvious in science.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.800
Because the alternative model,
alternative, which we know

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.610
today is of course wrong, is
that somehow the cell comes

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.079
along, feels this double helix
as a template, and somehow

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.000
builds two new strands
that are the same

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.930
as that double helix.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.930
They build a new double helix
with both strands being new.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.590
That's nuts--

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.350
why would you do it?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.530
It's so obvious you could
use one strand as the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.630
template for the other.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.420
But this is what Meselson and
Stahl had to rule out.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.230
They had to rule out that that
double helix stayed intact,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.980
and maybe the cell sent some
enzymes around to feel its

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.500
shape and somehow construct
another double helix like it.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.690
That would be a non-conservative
model.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.900
You weren't using
any old strands.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.370
The two old strands
stayed together.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.010
And you made two new strands.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.810
That's what they were trying to
distinguish between, this

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.910
semiconservative model or not.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.300
So I just remind you that their
really cool, cool idea--

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.650
see, they couldn't use a
radioactive tracer that was

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.140
different on the new strand
than the old strand in the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.710
conventional sense.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.730
Because, of course, they're made
out of the same atoms.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.860
But what they did do, as we
talked about last time, was

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.880
they take the DNA.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.020
They grow it up in
heavy nitrogen.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.570
They then shift the bacteria
to light nitrogen.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.970
And, if in fact the
Semiconservative Model is

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.290
right, then the new DNA after
one generation of growth will

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.940
have a lighter density.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.530
Very simple, except that they
had to go invent a way to

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.920
measure density.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.250
They had to invent this
centrifugation process where

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.780
they spin really, really,
really, really hard.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.560
And the salt gets a little
denser here, and a little less

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.380
dense here, and a little
less dense here.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.430
And it's not a very
huge difference.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.880
But if you know the density of
DNA, and you arrange your salt

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.190
concentration at just the right
density, you can spin it

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.710
really hard so that there's
some gradient in

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.550
density in the salt.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.740
And the heavier stuff
will band here.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.010
The lighter stuff from
one generation of

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.260
growth will band there.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.420
And normal DNA would
band there.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.110
And that's a pretty
convincing proof.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.950
After no generations
it's all in 15-15.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.900
After one generation it's
all intermediate.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.110
After two generations some
of it is now 14-14.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.050
Some of it is 14-15.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.590
And onward like that.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.200
Obvious, and it's a gorgeous
experiment, just a gorgeous

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.780
experiment.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.420
And this idea of density
centrifugation, which they

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.930
invented for this purpose, has
been used for many other

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.180
purposes since.
