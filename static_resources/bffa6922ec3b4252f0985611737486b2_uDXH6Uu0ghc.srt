8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,445
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

9
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:24,390
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,000
PROFESSOR: All right.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,650
So today--

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,860
I haven't seen you in a while.

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,930
Anyway, today, we're going to
turn back to our picture,

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,270
function gene protein.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,530
We filled in genetics.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,390
We filled in biochemistry.

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,540
We've now got the connection
between gene and protein

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,520
through molecular biology.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,450
We know gene encodes protein.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,730
We know central dogma,
DNA goes to the

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,560
RNA goes to the protein.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,100
We know all that in theory.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,820
In fact, people knew this by
the middle of the 1960s.

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,720
People were so excited that they
understood the idea of

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,130
how genes give rise to proteins
through transcription

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,890
and translation, they read the
genetic code, that they

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,620
declared victory.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,690
Some of them said, done with
the secret of life.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,560
Let's go on and do the brain.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,990
That was actually the thinking
of a lot of the great

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,380
molecular biologists
in the late 1960s.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,740
Let's go do the brain.

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,780
Why did they say such a thing?

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,100
Well, because they
thought they were

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,170
done with the problem.

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,440
They thought that once you knew
in principle how a gene

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,980
gave rise to a protein,
you could do it.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,220
But in practice, nobody could
read a single gene.

39
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,960
Nobody could even identify
a single gene.

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,980
Maybe that's why they went on
to say, let's go study the

41
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,620
brain, because they actually
weren't sure what they could

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,600
do past that point.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,170
All right.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,430
So wait a second,
wait a second.

45
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,440
I said nobody could even
purify a single gene.

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,661
Didn't we talk about purifying
the genetic material?

47
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,910
You're supposed to say
yes at that point.

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,580
Yes, right?

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,630
We talked about that.

50
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,590
Avery, McCarty, MacLeod-- we
purified the genetic material.

51
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,876
We did it by using this
assay of transforming.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,220
So what do I mean by we can't
purify a single gene?

53
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,610
What I mean is that we can
purify the hereditary material

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,670
away from everything else, but
we get all of it together.

55
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,800
We don't get individual genes
separated from each other.

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,250
We get the whole mixture
of all the genes,

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,550
all the genetic material.

58
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,910
As a biochemist, how are we
going to ever separate the

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,240
gene encoding--

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,520
oh I don't know, ARG1, our
favorite gene for arginine

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,580
biosynthesis--

62
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,670
from the gene encoding
ARG2, for example?

63
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,500
What kind of biochemistry
can we do to

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,880
separate these two genes?

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,660
Do they have different
biochemical properties?

66
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,350
What's so different about
ARG1 and ARG2?

67
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,504
What's their different
biochemical properties?

68
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,790
They're both DNA.

69
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,100
They have exactly the same
building blocks, slightly

70
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,180
different order.

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,350
You think you have a
purification procedure, I'm

72
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,800
going to run it over some column
and separate it by

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,040
something that's going to
separate ARG1 from ARG2?

74
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,570
No.

75
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,250
From the point of view of a
pure biochemist, they look

76
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,800
exactly the same.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,920
All the different genes have
the same biochemical

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
properties.

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,320
How in the world would we ever
purify ARG1 from ARG2, or in

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,830
the human, the gene encoding
hemoglobin from the gene

81
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,120
encoding collagen from the gene
encoding keratin from the

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,130
gene encoding anything else?

83
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,670
Think about it.

84
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,920
That's a tough problem.

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,970
There is a brilliant solution
that arose in the 1970s to how

86
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,330
we could purify the individual
genes away from each other.

87
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,180
But it's like no other piece
of biochemistry anybody had

88
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,870
ever seen before.

89
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,080
It has a totally different
principle behind it.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,860
Because it isn't just
fractionating things according

91
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,550
to their biochemical
properties.

92
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,410
It involves something else.

93
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,100
And it's called cloning.

94
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,990
It is called cloning.

95
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,095
Molecular cloning.

96
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,520
You see, the problem is this.

97
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,350
The human genome--

98
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,760
how big is the human genome?

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,630
How many bases?

100
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,630
Three billion bases, three
times 10 to the

101
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,440
ninth bases, right?

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,150
How big is a typical
human gene?

103
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,380
A typical human gene might
be 30,000 bases.

104
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,610
How big is a typical mutation
that we might want to find in

105
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,340
a typical gene, like causing
sickle cell anemia?

106
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,290
One base.

107
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,580
We've got to purify out genes
that are one part in 10 to the

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,660
fifth and mutations that
are one part in 10 to

109
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,972
the ninth or so.

110
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,680
And how are we going
to do that?

111
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Well, the trick is this.

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,010
I'll give you the quick
overview, and then we'll spend

113
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,180
today looking at it.

114
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,150
Step one is we cut up our DNA.

115
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:32,790
We cut DNA at defined sites, and
we then paste the DNA to

116
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,520
distinct molecules
called vectors.

117
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,640
These vectors have a cool
property, that when you take a

118
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,360
vector and you insert in it a
piece of DNA, that vector is

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,880
able to grow in another
organism.

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,840
You then transform the DNA--

121
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,970
that's transfer, we use the
word transform the DNA--

122
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,550
into something like E. coli,
where you get your little

123
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,490
vector in there.

124
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,110
It grows within E. coli, and as
E. coli divides, it makes

125
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,680
copies of itself.

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:23,750
And then you select those
bacteria that have received,

127
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:31,430
that have been transformed, grow
them up on a petri plate

128
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,460
so that you have little
colonies.

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,620
And then you screen
the colonies.

130
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,040
Now, what do I mean?

131
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,960
We cut the DNA.

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,020
We paste the DNA.

133
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,750
We transform the DNA.

134
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,200
We select the bacteria that
have been successfully

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,090
transformed.

136
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,610
And we screen the resulting
colonies to find what we're

137
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,510
looking for.

138
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,420
Now, notice--

139
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,990
that amazing trick here is when
we cut up the DNA into

140
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,910
single molecules, lots and lots
of single molecules, and

141
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,460
we paste them into vectors,
and we transform them into

142
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,880
bacteria, each one of those
bacteria gets exactly one

143
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,450
molecule, give or take.

144
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,930
It gets one piece
of human DNA.

145
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,810
We then spread them out on a
plate and they grow up, and

146
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,840
each one grows up
copies for us of

147
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,020
individual pieces of DNA.

148
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,420
That is so cool.

149
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,120
Because we've just accomplished
biochemical

150
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,790
purification.

151
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,850
It's not based on any different
properties of the

152
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,190
individual molecules.

153
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,060
It's based on the fact that
we dilute them, in effect.

154
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,800
They're diluted, and
one molecule

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,620
ends up in each bacteria.

156
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,440
So they're purified
in that sense.

157
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,980
And then when that bacteria
grows up, everything it grows

158
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,620
up is a pure copy, a copy of
that single piece of DNA that

159
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,020
went into it.

160
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,030
That's a different kind
of purification.

161
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,840
When I'm done-- and we'll go
through this whole process.

162
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,365
That's the point of today's
lecture, is to go through the

163
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:56,880
whole process.

164
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,770
When I'm done, I have
bacteria spread out.

165
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,260
And right over there, one of
these guys has ARG1, and one

166
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,740
of these guys has ARG2, and one
of these guys has ARG10.

167
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,800
Now, admittedly, I don't know
which one has which, but I've

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,740
accomplished the purification.

169
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,070
I'll then have to figure out
how to screen and find out

170
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,300
which one is which, but I have
separated the molecules away

171
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,950
from each other by this process
of cloning, diluting

172
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,540
them in a way--

173
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,530
one molecule per bacteria--

174
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,961
and growing them back up.

175
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,300
I could do this for anything.

176
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,690
I could dilute proteins down
into test tubes that had one

177
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,919
protein molecule per test tube,
and I could say I've

178
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,100
accomplished purification.

179
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,110
The problem with it is I have
no way to replicate those

180
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,320
proteins to get a meaningful
amount of it.

181
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,480
But when it's DNA, and I've put
it back into a bacteria, I

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,020
have a way to grow it back up.

183
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,730
And that's why this
trick works--

184
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,940
is because DNA is a molecule
that can replicate.

185
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,550
No other molecule has
that cool property.

186
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,500
And so you can pull
this off for DNA.

187
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,050
All right.

188
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,160
Now we have to dive in to
understand how this could

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,410
possibly work.
