1
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,960
HAZEL SIVE: All right.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,830
Let's move on to the second
topic of our discussion today,

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,500
which we will start today and
then continue on Friday.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,580
And this is a discussion
of the proteins.

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,970
The proteins, probably the
most fascinating class of

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:46,180
macromolecules, 55% of the dry
mass of a cell, and proteins

7
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,320
function everywhere.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,835
They do almost everything.

9
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
Strictly speaking, proteins
are not hereditary

10
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,910
information, although Professor
Jacks will talk with

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,670
you about a class of proteins
called prions, which kind of

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,180
are hereditary information.

13
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,810
So not hereditary info,
but they do

14
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,700
almost everything else.

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,155
They form the structure
of the cell.

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,520
They form a major class of
catalysts called enzymes that

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,060
we will talk about on Friday.

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,050
They function in defense as
in the immune system.

19
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,040
They allow cells to move,
dot, dot, dot.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,580
Okay?

21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,650
We'll talk about proteins on and
on and on as major players

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,110
in the fabric of life.

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:08,990
Their monomer is an amino
acid that is abbreviated

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,950
AA or little aa.

25
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,360
And it has a particular
structure that forms around a

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,060
central carbon, which is called
the alpha carbon.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,190
And from this alpha carbon,
there are four groups that

28
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,220
emanate, something called R,
which is the functional

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,480
interesting group of
each amino acid.

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:49,400
So R is characteristic of each
class of amino acid.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,150
We'll talk more about
this in a moment.

32
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,920
And then we'll put in a hydrogen
and then there is a

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,530
nitrogen or an amine group,
which I'm going to draw here

34
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,640
as NH3 positive.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,180
And the other group is a
carboxyl group, which I'm

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,050
going to draw here
again as ionized.

37
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,270
So R, actually, I'm going to
give a special name to.

38
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,970
We'll call it a side chain.

39
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,620
And this side chain can
be a charged group.

40
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,915
It can be polar or non-polar.

41
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,810
And let me see what I have
as the first thing.

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,200
Yes.

43
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,130
Here are some of the side groups
in amino acids, for

44
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,750
example, lysine.

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,190
Here is the alpha carbon, and
here's its side group.

46
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,180
You can see it ends
in an amino group.

47
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,870
It's positively charged.

48
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,580
Glutamic acid, I keep forgetting
glutamic acid.

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,590
This is a better screen.

50
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,440
Glutamic acid ends.

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,290
It's got a carboxyl
group at the end.

52
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,155
It's negatively charged.

53
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,680
It's an acid.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,940
Here's one, tyrosine with
a polar uncharged group.

55
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,450
This benzene ring and the
hydroxyl gives some polarity

56
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,660
to the molecule and here's
leucine with a

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,460
hydroxyl gives polarity.

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,170
Leucine is non-polar.

59
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,160
It's really a hydrocarbon and
cystine has this interesting

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,760
very reactive sulfhydryl group
at the end of its R chain,

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,860
which is capable of reacting
with another sulfhydryl group

62
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,680
and forming a disulfide bond.

63
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,000
The polymer, actually I think
I could write it here, the

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:53,190
polymer of amino acids looks
like this, and it's called a

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:03,230
peptide if it's less than 20
amino acids and a protein if

66
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,640
it's about more than
20 amino acids, but

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,700
that's kind of loose.

68
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,400
You should know the term
peptide, polypeptide mean

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,440
something a bit bigger than a
peptide, protein, they're all

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,090
the same chemical structure --

71
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,880
just refers to differences
in the amount of

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,380
sequence in the polymer.

73
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,490
How does the protein
polymer form?

74
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,340
I'll draw that for you now.

75
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,050
And it forms by making a
particular bond called a

76
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,480
peptide bond that you should
know and be able to recognize.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,690
So let's draw amino acid
one with carbon.

78
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:50,100
And we're going to put its amino
group, its hydrogren,

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,040
and then its carboxyl group.

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,430
And we're going to add to it.

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,210
So this is going to be amino
acid one, and we're going to

82
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,915
add to it another one with
a second side chain.

83
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:08,760
And here, we'll draw out the
hydrogens on the amino group.

84
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,780
This oxygen and the hydrogens
on the amino group are going

85
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,840
to interact, and they are
going to undergo a

86
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,570
condensation reaction.

87
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,820
And actually I realize when I
drew for you the nucleotide

88
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,050
condensation reaction, that
was when we drew the

89
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,460
dinucleotide that was forming,
I realize I didn't put that

90
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,970
there was elimination of a
molecule as the dinucleotide

91
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,440
was forming.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,980
It's a bit complicated, and that
was why I didn't do it.

93
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,100
But in this case, this is a kind
of classic condensation

94
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,950
reaction, which will eliminate
water, and you'll end up with

95
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,550
something that looks
like this.

96
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,120
So here's your alpha.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm going to circle the alpha
carbon so we don't

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,850
get where they are.

99
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,680
And then we've got a carbonyl
group that's joined to an

100
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,910
amine and then the other
alpha carbon, R2.

101
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,600
So here is amino acid
one, amino acid two.

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,320
And here is a dipeptide,
or diamino acid.

103
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,270
It doesn't really matter
what you call it.

104
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:46,510
The peptide bond is this guy,
and it's a very, very

105
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,725
important bond.

106
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:53,410
It holds the protein chain
together, and you need to be

107
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,770
able to recognize it.

108
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,690
Two other features of this
as well, which will be

109
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,890
reminiscent of the nucleic acid
case, and on one end --

110
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,890
the ends are different.

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,380
Okay?

112
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,030
The ends are different.

113
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:16,470
On one end, there is a free
amino group, and this is

114
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:24,930
called the amino end or the
N-terminal of the dipeptide or

115
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,580
of the protein.

116
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:37,320
And on the other end, there is
a free carboxyl group, and

117
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:47,440
this is termed the carboxyl or
the carboxy, or the C-terminal

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,660
of this dipeptide, or indeed
of any protein.

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,160
So this is going to sound
reminiscent of the case as in

120
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,460
nucleic acids because like
nucleic acids, proteins,

121
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,990
because they have different
ends, have a linear order.

122
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:15,980
So we'll write it again,
different ends

123
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,350
and a linear order.

124
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,350
And again, it's this linear
order that can only be read in

125
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,040
one direction or that leads
to information that is not

126
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,250
symmetric or not randomly
oriented that gives the

127
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,530
protein its particular
properties.

128
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,370
So let's write this out
again, formally.

129
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,770
On one end, there's
the amino end.

130
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,900
You can also write
this as NH2.

131
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,590
It's done kind of casually.

132
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,270
You can write it as N. Doesn't
really matter to us.

133
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,710
And then here's your polymer
of amino acids.

134
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,060
And here is your carboxy end.

135
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,470
You can write COO.

136
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,570
I always write COOH.

137
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,460
You can also write C. All of
those are kind of given as

138
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,250
being equivalent and this is
your amino end and your

139
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,580
carboxy end.

140
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,680
That's terminology, but you can
tell from where these free

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,720
chemical groups are which amino
acid was added first and

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,130
which was added last.

143
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,060
And the amino acid nearest the
end terminal is added first.

144
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,020
The one nearest the free carboxy
is the most recently

145
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,470
added, always added last.

146
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,200
Now, we went through a bit of
a calculation for nucleic

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,180
acids where there are four
bases, and I pointed out to

148
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,200
you that you could get a lot of
combinatorics out of four

149
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,620
bases if you had a polymer
that was long enough.

150
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,080
For proteins, the situation
is actually

151
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,810
dauntingly more complex.

152
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,565
There are 20 different
amino acids.

153
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:24,470
So for a peptide, that's three
amino acids, you would get 20

154
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:34,760
to the third combinations
or 8,000.

155
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:45,060
Proteins can be greater than
1,000 amino acids in length.

156
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,810
Proteins or peptides for little
ones can range from two

157
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,960
to greater than 1,000
amino acids.

158
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,770
And so the number of
combinations of information

159
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,300
that you can get in proteins
is enormous, and that means

160
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,050
that most of protein space has
not been explored by life and

161
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,470
can be explored in
the laboratory.

162
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,700
And that's very exciting in
thinking about the various

163
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,840
functions that one can find that
have not yet been found.

164
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,870
Now, the thing that is different
about nucleic acids

165
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,670
and proteins apart from their
fundamental chemical

166
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,590
structure, is that nucleic
acids, as we will discuss, are

167
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,000
used as a linear more
or less, they are

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,930
read as a linear string.

169
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,740
You start somewhere, and you
read along the nucleic acid,

170
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,700
and you get your information
out, and that gives you some

171
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,830
kind of a next step.

172
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,820
Proteins, although they have a
linear order, are not used in

173
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,990
this kind of straight
linear way.

174
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,490
They are read once they
have folded up into

175
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,650
three-dimensional structures,
and the folding of proteins

176
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,860
into these 3D structures is
intrinsic and essential for

177
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,171
their function.

178
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,421
So protein folding --

179
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,910
Actually, let me before we do
protein folding, I realize

180
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,580
I've been remiss in giving
you these slides.

181
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,470
Here is something I drew
for you on amino acid

182
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,643
polymerization from your
book, and here we are

183
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,300
where we should be.

184
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,320
Protein folding is required
for function.

185
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,580
The linear order of amino acids
in the first peptide

186
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,170
chain that is synthesized is
called the primary structure.

187
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,380
So primary structure refers
to the linear

188
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,650
order of amino acids.

189
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,160
And these amino acids, of
course, are held together by

190
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,690
covalent bonds as in
peptide bonds.

191
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,220
But this primary structure,
while absolutely essential for

192
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,000
protein function, is not
the functional protein.

193
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,880
It folds up, this primary
structure, this linear chain,

194
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,780
folds up and folds again
and folds again.

195
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,850
The way I think of it is, if you
took a piece of string or

196
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,580
an old-fashioned telephone cord,
and you folded it up,

197
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,110
you start rolling it up into a
roll, it will roll up, and

198
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,810
it'll fold back on itself, and
fold back on itself, and fold

199
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,170
back on itself.

200
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,770
And that's kind of the
deal with proteins.

201
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,540
So we have to consider something
called secondary

202
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:10,750
structure where the linear chain
of amino acids folds

203
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,310
back on itself.

204
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:23,150
So the linear amino acid
chain folds up, and it

205
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,060
does so in two ways.

206
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,810
It forms something called an
alpha helix or it forms

207
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,420
something called a beta sheet
or a beta pleated sheet, and

208
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,480
these are characteristics
folding structure or folding

209
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,360
patterns that are governed
by hydrogen bonds.

210
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,860
But that secondary structure
of the protein is not the

211
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,050
functional protein.

212
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,180
Those folded hydrogen-bonded
alpha helices or beta sheets

213
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:06,910
fold on themselves again to form
the tertiary structure of

214
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,270
the protein.

215
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:16,900
So this is more folding
of the alpha

216
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:24,270
helices or the beta sheets.

217
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,060
And this tertiary structure
can involve any number of

218
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,840
different kinds of bonds.

219
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,800
It can involve covalent bonds
like sulfhydryl disulfide

220
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,330
bonds, hydrogen bonds,
hydrophobic bonds, and all of

221
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,960
these things give a tertiary
structure.

222
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,720
All of them use one linear
polypeptide or protein chain.

223
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,610
But then there's a fourth
folding that is required for

224
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,720
the function of many proteins.

225
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,670
This is the quaternary
structure, and this refers to,

226
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:11,504
so again, this is of the primary
and secondary chain.

227
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,270
The quaternary structure is
an association between two

228
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,020
different proteins in a
non-covalent way, usually.

229
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:46,370
So this is association between
two different protein chains

230
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,300
and two different protein chains
that are in some kind

231
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,230
of tertiary structure.

232
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,520
And usually this association
is non-covalent.

233
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,450
The way protein structure is
governed and proteins fold is

234
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,480
mysterious, and very
complicated, and not well

235
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,600
understood.

236
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,350
And there we go.

237
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,000
Look at this interesting stuff
you can see on my screen.

238
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,140
Here we go.

239
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,370
Here, not from your book because
I think it's better

240
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,490
from a different book, is a
picture of an alpha helix, a

241
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:31,330
beta sheet, tertiary structures
of folded

242
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,290
polypeptide chains.

243
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,650
And here is a quaternary
structure.

244
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,930
And as we'll talk about on
Friday, it's the quaternary

245
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,890
structures that are these
functional units called

246
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,370
enzymes, and we'll stop there.
