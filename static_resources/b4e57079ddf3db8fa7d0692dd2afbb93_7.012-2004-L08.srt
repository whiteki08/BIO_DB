1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
Let's dive in
today and look at

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
how geneticists use genetics.
I've told you up until now about

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
some of the history of genetics
and how it gave rise to our

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
understandings about genetic
transmission in traits, about

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
genetic mapping,
linkage analysis,

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
how all this helped confirm
the Chromosomes Theory.

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
And we wove in a number of concepts
about how scientific theories are

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
developed and data is interpreted
and intuitions are made,

9
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
and then how they're actually proven,
what sort of evidence it takes to

10
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
actually achieve
conscientious around theories.

11
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
And that often takes sometimes
years, many times decades before

12
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
full contentious is achieved around
things. Today I want to turn a

13
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
little bit to the experimental uses
of genetics in a more day-to-day

14
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
fashion. And you will recall this
coat of arms that I put up here.

15
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
Function. Gene.
Protein. Biochemistry.

16
00:01:05 --> 00:01:10
Genetics. And I told you about how
these were two different ways to

17
00:01:10 --> 00:01:15
study biological function.
Today I want to talk a little bit

18
00:01:15 --> 00:01:20
about how we use genetics
to study biological function.

19
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
And, in particular, I'm going to
pick some examples of how we use

20
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30
genetics to study biological
function that have to do with the

21
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
biological functions
of biochemistry.

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
So already we're beginning to look
ahead to this connection between

23
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
gene and protein, which
molecular biology will

24
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
establish for us. So, suppose
you want to do genetics.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
You've got to study some organism.
We talked already about Mendel's

26
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
choice of organism, the pea.
We talked about some of its

27
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages you could get pure

28
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
breeding strains in the market,
you could, when you're done with the

29
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
experiments, feed it to the other
monks. There were a lot of things

30
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
like that, that were
advantageous about the pea,

31
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
but it had problems of generation
time. You would only get,

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
certainly in Europe, a generation or
so a year. In Northern Europe maybe

33
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
you could squeeze a second
generation in not so good.

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
Fruit flies, a very attractive
system in many respects because you

35
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
could grow many,
much larger numbers.

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
The generation time is on the order
of two weeks or so to go from a

37
00:02:36 --> 00:02:40
fertilized fly embryo, a fly
egg developing into a fly,

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
developing into a mature adult,
able itself to have offspring.

39
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
So, very attractive. There are
other systems that people studied.

40
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
And, of course, one of the reasons
they study this system is because

41
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
it's interesting, I'm sorry,
because it's tractable.

42
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
And the other reason is
because it's interesting.

43
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
So, tractability is very
important to a geneticist, right?

44
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
The number of whale geneticists
is few, for the most part.

45
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
But we also want to choose our
system because of what it will tell

46
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
us about the system we want to
study. Like if you want to study

47
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
distinctive things about the immune
system, you might want to study them

48
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
in mice, or if you could
even study them in people,

49
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
although you can't set up crosses
in people. We'll come to that on

50
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Monday. If you wanted to study
things about basic aspects of

51
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
development, you might
study them in fruit flies.

52
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
And if you wanted to study basic
biochemistry, the place to study

53
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
basic biochemistry might best be
done in single-celled organisms,

54
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
which also have to carry out
biochemical pathways like glycolysis

55
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
and synthesis of amino
acids and things like that.

56
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
They're going to be, by far,
the most tractable systems.

57
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
And so, people are particularly
fond for doing things like studying

58
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
basic biochemistry and many other
aspects of basic molecular biology

59
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
to studying the organism yeast.
Yeast is a friend of human beings.

60
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
Certainly, yeast has been an
intensely studied organism because

61
00:04:06 --> 00:04:11
of its practical benefits
in the making of bread,

62
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
in the making of beer.
So, fermentation processes,

63
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
dough rising and all that. But
yeast also is a tremendously

64
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
important organism for the
geneticist. It is an extremely

65
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
elegant experimental
system. Yeast is a fungus.

66
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
It is a single-celled eukaryote.
That is true nucleus. It's got

67
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
chromosomes that pair up. It's
cells, through a first order

68
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
approximation, that are
an awful lot like your

69
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
cells in terms of having all of
the basic important eukaryotic

70
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
organelles in the nucleus,
mitochondria, other things like that.

71
00:04:56 --> 00:05:01
So, yeast is a
great model for many

72
00:05:01 --> 00:05:06
purposes. And we're not going to
talk much about the cell biology of

73
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
yeast, but I do want to talk
about the husbandry of yeast,

74
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
how it is that you grow yeast.
So, the way a geneticists grows

75
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
yeast is take growth medium
that has lots of rich nutrients.

76
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
You could take a broth with lots of
amino acids and all sorts of stuff,

77
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
you know, a little bit of
salt, lots of water of course.

78
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
And if you take a single yeast cell
and it's got lots and lots of rich

79
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
nutrients in this broth here,
you put your yeast cell into the

80
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
broth, so I will do that.
Here's my flask, here's my little

81
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
rod which has a yeast cell or a
couple of yeast cells on the end of

82
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
it. I put it in there and I grow
it at an appropriate temperature.

83
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
Let's say 30 degrees, for example,
would be a nice temperature.

84
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
I could do that if I wanted to.
Then a C obviously. I grow it up

85
00:06:05 --> 00:06:10
and I get a culture of yeast in
there. And I can tell because this

86
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
nice clear broth is now all cloudy
with yeast that's grown up in it.

87
00:06:15 --> 00:06:20
Now I want to study these guys, so
what I do is I pour them out onto a

88
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
Petri plate. The Petri plate has
on it a medium, a solid medium,

89
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
an agar medium that
again has nutrients.

90
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
And if I pour this out,
and I pour out a lot of it,

91
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
what will happen? Well, there will
be yeast all over the place and it

92
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
will be very smootsie. There
will be like yeast cells

93
00:06:43 --> 00:06:48
everywhere and it's
not very organized. So,

94
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
what I want to do is I want to
take that and I want to dilute it.

95
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
I want to take only a little bit
of the broth and put a little bit of

96
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
the broth on my plate. Maybe
I'll have diluted it first.

97
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
And then I want to spread it
around with a little spreader,

98
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
here's a little glass spreader maybe
or something, and push it back and

99
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
forth, so that really there are just
individual single cells scattered

100
00:07:19 --> 00:07:24
randomly, scattered around.
And so, then this cell begins to

101
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
grow and divide and divide
and divide and I get a colony.

102
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
A little hill of cells all of which
descend from a single cell that was

103
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
put into that position. And
the reason I know that they all

104
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
descend from a single cell is
because most of this plate does not

105
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
have cells on it. Most
of the plate is sparse.

106
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
I've just got cells, cells, cells,
cells scattered about. And because

107
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
of that I know that these
had of been individual events.

108
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
These things are called colonies.
Now, when yeast grows and divides

109
00:08:03 --> 00:08:10
like that, let's take a moment
and talk about its life cycle.

110
00:08:10 --> 00:08:17
We'll introduce its life cycle
here. Yeast proper eukaryote,

111
00:08:17 --> 00:08:24
so it has a diploid stage. It
grows as a diploid. And it can

112
00:08:24 --> 00:08:31
undergo mitosis in which all
of the chromosomes line up, as

113
00:08:31 --> 00:08:38
we talked about. They've
already pre-replicated so

114
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
that they'll be ready to divide up
and give one to each daughter cell,

115
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
and there you go. N for yeast is
16. Yeast happens to have 16 pairs of

116
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
chromosomes. Peas had seven.
Humans have 23 pairs. Every

117
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
organism has its own yeast of
16. Now, what we do is we undergo

118
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
meiosis to make haploid cells,
sperm or eggs in the human

119
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
population. Yeast also
undergoes meiosis to make spores.

120
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
It sporulates and it produces
spores. And it turns out these

121
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
spores, of course as you would
expect, have N chromosomes.

122
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
They undergo meiosis just
as we drew it on the board.

123
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
And these can come in two flavors.
They happen to come not in male and

124
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
females, but A and alpha, there
you go. A and alpha cells can

125
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
mate together to produce,
again, a diploid. They fertilize

126
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
and can produce a diploid. They
fuse to do that. And you now

127
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
get back to a diploid from your
haploid. So, this looks just

128
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
identical to the human genetic cycle
here, but there is one difference.

129
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
What's the difference?
Sorry? Time. Yes,

130
00:10:02 --> 00:10:07
it's true. Yeast can divide
much more rapidly. Yeast can have

131
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
offspring extremely rapidly
over a course of a day or so.

132
00:10:12 --> 00:10:17
And humans take somewhat
longer than that. They,

133
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
for example, have to wait until
they get out of college to be able to

134
00:10:23 --> 00:10:28
reproduce mostly. What
else? There's one other

135
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
important thing. It turns
out that yeast can also

136
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
undergo mitosis as a
haploid. In other words,

137
00:10:38 --> 00:10:43
the haploid cells of yeast, when
it makes individual haploids,

138
00:10:43 --> 00:10:49
they can continue to grow
indefinitely. By contrast,

139
00:10:49 --> 00:10:54
your gametes cannot. You do not
have an independent human stage in

140
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
which you are haploid, or
your gametes are haploid.

141
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Whereas, yeast can hang out as a
haploid for a very long time until

142
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
it decides it wants to mate.
This is very convenient for

143
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
geneticists. Geneticists like this
because it means we can grow the

144
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
thing as a diploid, we can
grow the thing as a haploid.

145
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
When we want to mate them,
we can mate them together,

146
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
but we can also study them alone.
And, you could imagine, this is

147
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
going to be really good for
studying recessive traits,

148
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
right? So, that's one of the
reasons why geneticists are fond of

149
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
yeast. There are many reasons
geneticists are fond of yeast.

150
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
Just growing yeast, it
smells very nice in the lab.

151
00:11:30 --> 00:11:40
For example, try growing E.
coli by comparison. So, now,

152
00:11:40 --> 00:11:50
it turns out that yeast is very
happy if you grow it on rich medium.

153
00:11:50 --> 00:12:00
But yeast can grow on minimal
media with very few macro molecules.

154
00:12:00 --> 00:12:08
It needs a carbon source which
is some sugar that it can ferment.

155
00:12:08 --> 00:12:17
It needs a nitrogen. It needs
some simple source of nitrogen.

156
00:12:17 --> 00:12:25
It needs some simple source of
nitrogen. It needs a source of

157
00:12:25 --> 00:12:34
phosphorus. It needs some other
trace salts and things like that.

158
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
And obviously it needs some water.
That's it. If you think about

159
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
what's in a yeast cell, like
it's got phospholipid bilayers.

160
00:12:43 --> 00:12:48
But you're not giving
it any phospholipids.

161
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
Why is it able to grow? It
makes them. What about proteins?

162
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
They're made up of 20 amino acids.
You're not giving it any amino

163
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
acids. Why? It makes them.
Yeast is extraordinarily

164
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
self-reliant. You, by contrast,
are not as self-reliant.

165
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
There are a number of amino
acids which, if I don't give you,

166
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
you can't live because you don't
actually have the ability to make

167
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
those amino acids. But yeast
is able to make the vast

168
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
majority of things. Basically,
you almost just needed

169
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
to give it the elements. As
for carbon sources and things

170
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
like that, it's very happy with a
wide variety of fermentable sugars.

171
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
You can give it glucose.
You can give it sucrose.

172
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
You can give it galactose.
You can give it fructose and it

173
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
will deal. So, yeast
is very well set up

174
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
metabolically. So, it's
got all of these pathways

175
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
of the sort Bob has talked about for
being able to breakdown the things

176
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
you give it and being able to
synthesize up the things it needs.

177
00:13:50 --> 00:13:54
Now, yeast, of course, is not
stupid. Because if you give it

178
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
amino acids it will use it. If
you give it all sorts of other

179
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
things it will use it. So,
yeast is able to use rich media

180
00:14:04 --> 00:14:14
that have lots of complex
nutrients and macromolecules.

181
00:14:14 --> 00:14:23
So, it has an ability, it has
everything it needs to make

182
00:14:23 --> 00:14:33
these things, but it has
an ability to regulate that.

183
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
So, the processes, the
enzymatic pathways that produce

184
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
complex macromolecules,
amino acids, phospholipids,

185
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
et cetera, will be down regulated,
shut off, or at least decreased if

186
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
you provide it with
these macromolecules.

187
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
That's an interesting question
of how it manages to regulate its

188
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
biochemistry. Why does it care?
Why doesn't it, why not just have

189
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
those pathways be on all the
time? Sorry? Waste of energy.

190
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
It needs ATP. It costs money.
So, at the beginning probably they

191
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
were on all the time,
but some yeast evolves,

192
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
or some precursor to yeast
evolves that's able to regulate it.

193
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
That one is able to be
more frugal with its energy.

194
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
It outgrows its other ones
and then another, dah, dah,

195
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
dah. Any place you can make
a few ATPs here or there,

196
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
eventually the organism that does
it will out compete the organism that

197
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
doesn't. And so, rather
fine control of this,

198
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
which is a topic we'll
come to in a couple of days,

199
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
gene regulation and other
kinds of pathway regulation is

200
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
very important. OK. So,
we want to know how does it

201
00:15:33 --> 00:15:39
do it? What are the enzymes?
What are the pathways? How does it

202
00:15:39 --> 00:15:46
actually make,
oh, I don't know,

203
00:15:46 --> 00:15:53
arginine? How does it make arginine,
amino acid? How would you find out

204
00:15:53 --> 00:16:00
how yeast makes arginine? How
can yeast synthesize arginines?

205
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
So, you remember our picture that
the biochemist wants to study a

206
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
problem by grinding up the cell
and purifying a component able to do

207
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
something. So, a biochemist
might want to grind up

208
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
the cell and purify an
enzyme that can make arginine.

209
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
Form what, of course, is
an interesting question?

210
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
And then the thing that made the
thing that was used to substrate,

211
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
et cetera, et cetera.
What would a geneticist do?

212
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
How does a geneticist approach
the problem with how does

213
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
yeast make arginine? Find
a yeast that cannot make it,

214
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
that's what we do. That is.
So, what we need is a mutant.

215
00:16:39 --> 00:16:46
A geneticist wants a
yeast that cannot make it.

216
00:16:46 --> 00:16:53
A geneticist wants mutants.
How do you find the mutant? You

217
00:16:53 --> 00:17:00
find the mutant by
going on a mutant hunt.

218
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
That is what geneticists refer to it
as. And it's a very exciting thing.

219
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
You go off, load up the guns and go
off into the bush on a mutant hunt.

220
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
And so, I want to talk about
the strategy for a mutant hunt.

221
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
How do we look for a yeast
that can't make arginine?

222
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
Sorry? Cannot. I've got a
yeast that can make arginine,

223
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
because normal wild type yeast
can grow on minimal media without

224
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
arginine supplied.
And, when I examine it,

225
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
it's got arginine in it.
Yes? So, who should I find?

226
00:17:32 --> 00:17:37
Proteins that contain arginine and
then it doesn't have the proteins

227
00:17:37 --> 00:17:42
that doesn't have arginine.
Interesting. Now, the problem is

228
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
almost all proteins will have an
arginine, or the vast majority of

229
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
them. And a yeast that lacked all
those proteins that didn't have

230
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
arginine would not be much
of a yeast. I think it would

231
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
be pretty dead. So, it's
a good thought if it was a

232
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
more dispensable function.
But that's going to be tough.

233
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
Or, maybe I can use the fact
that it's dead. Now in a sense,

234
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
can I find the yeast? Yes?
You had a thought on this.

235
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
Yes? Kill all yeast that
make arginine, excellent.

236
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
So, if I had a chemical agent
that could kill yeast that can make

237
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
arginine, I could only get the yeast
that make it. How would I do that?

238
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
That's a very interesting idea.
You're right. You could construct

239
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
the chemical molecule in the
arginine pathway which when it was

240
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
broken down enzymatically
made some toxic product,

241
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
and only those yeasts that couldn't
break it down would be able to grow,

242
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
et cetera, et cetera, and I could
select. That's a very cleaver idea.

243
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
But I'd also have to know an awful
lot about the pathway in advance.

244
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
So, suppose I didn't' know the
pathway. Suppose I knew nothing

245
00:18:58 --> 00:19:03
about how arginine gets
made. Yes? Excellent. So,

246
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
I take, I mean geneticists are
simpleminded folks and they like

247
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
simple solutions. Take
medium in which you've given

248
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
the yeast arginine, grow it
up, and then pour it out on

249
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
a plate that doesn't have arginine.
Everybody got this idea? So, we're

250
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
going to take yeast. We're
going to grow it up in medium

251
00:19:32 --> 00:19:37
which contains arginine
with arginine. So,

252
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
now yeasts, those mutants that arose
by chance that are unable to make

253
00:19:42 --> 00:19:47
their own arginine are still able
to grow here. And then we dump it out

254
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
onto a plate that has minimal
media without arginine,

255
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
no arginine, and those ones that can
grow up are the ones that we're not

256
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
interested in. And the
ones that don't appear are

257
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07
the ones we're interested in.
But, wait a second, that's the

258
00:20:07 --> 00:20:12
problem, isn't it,
because they're not here.

259
00:20:12 --> 00:20:17
How do we study them if they're not
there? What can we do about that?

260
00:20:17 --> 00:20:22
Yes. You want to see if you can
help us. Remove the ones that grew

261
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
up. So, get in there,
scrap them off, now put some

262
00:20:27 --> 00:20:34
arginine on. We're
getting to the idea.

263
00:20:34 --> 00:20:42
Maybe we can set this up
more elegantly, though.

264
00:20:42 --> 00:20:51
Thoughts? How can we, yes?
Make a bet? Make a guess?

265
00:20:51 --> 00:21:00
I can make that guess,
but how do I find them?

266
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
Here's a simple,
simple, simple idea.

267
00:21:06 --> 00:21:13
Let me try a simple idea. How
about I grow up these yeast,

268
00:21:13 --> 00:21:19
and instead of plating
them on minimal medium,

269
00:21:19 --> 00:21:26
let's be good to them. Let's
plate them on minimal medium.

270
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
Good. That's interesting. Let's
plate them on minimal medium

271
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
plus arginine. Or,
actually, if we wanted to,

272
00:21:38 --> 00:21:43
we could even plate them on rich
medium. We'll be really good to

273
00:21:43 --> 00:21:49
them. Either way. So, now,
let's let each one grow up.

274
00:21:49 --> 00:21:55
And here will be the ones that
can grow and the ones that can't

275
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
grow with arginine. Now
let me take a plate that is

276
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
minimal medium. And now
let me take a toothpick,

277
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
put a little toothpick there and
carry over this colony to there.

278
00:22:08 --> 00:22:13
Let me take a toothpick and
carry this guy over to here and a

279
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
toothpick and carry this
guy to here, and a toothpick,

280
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
and a toothpick, and a toothpick.
And all I have to do is keep

281
00:22:21 --> 00:22:26
transferring, one at
a time, these colonies.

282
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
And now I can see that somewhere
there was a colony that grew fine

283
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
when I gave it,
say, rich medium,

284
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
or minimal plus arginine, and
a colony that didn't grow when I

285
00:22:36 --> 00:22:40
put it on minimal medium.
That would at least show,

286
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
so, of course, the issue is I first
have to find them by growing them on

287
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
something where I've given the
arginine and then I can see that

288
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
they can't grow. All
right. This is what

289
00:22:51 --> 00:22:54
geneticists basically do. What
happens if I grew them on rich

290
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
medium and I transferred them
to minimal medium? Why might

291
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
something not grow? It might
be missing the ability to

292
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
make tryptophan. It might
be missing the ability to

293
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
make proline. It might be missing
the ability to make something else.

294
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
So, what I can do is, if I wanted
to, make a very broad mutant hunt.

295
00:23:14 --> 00:23:19
I could just first grow on rich
medium and then plate on minimal

296
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
medium and any yeast that has lost
the ability to make some essential

297
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
nutrient will be evident by its
absence on the minimal medium plate.

298
00:23:27 --> 00:23:33
So, we have for yeasts.
Yeasts that are able to grow on

299
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
minimal media are called prototrophs.
They are the wild type that can

300
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
grow on minimal media. They
can make everything themselves.

301
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
Yeasts that need help, that
cannot grow by themselves,

302
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
that need help, that need a
supplement are called auxotrophs.

303
00:23:57 --> 00:24:03
Auxo obviously meaning help. So,
it's a mutant that has lost the

304
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
ability to grow on minimal medium
and that it needs a supplement of

305
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
some kind. So, if I wanted
to, I could just first

306
00:24:15 --> 00:24:21
collect lots and lots and lots of
auxotrophs and then figure out what

307
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
they need. So, I might
collect a large collection

308
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
of auxotrophs. And then
test to see if supplying

309
00:24:33 --> 00:24:40
arginine rescues them. I
could also test tryptophan.

310
00:24:40 --> 00:24:48
So, if I only, only, only cared
about finding arginine auxotrophs,

311
00:24:48 --> 00:24:55
I could just grow them on
minimal plus arginine and then

312
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
test them on minimal. And
then I would know in advance,

313
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
these guys all grew with arginine
on minimal and didn't grow without

314
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
arginine, and I'd know
it was arginine. Or,

315
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
if I was in an expansive mood,
I could test them on rich medium,

316
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
collect everybody who's
unable to grow on minimal,

317
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
and then work out what the
reason is. Is it arginine?

318
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
Is it proline? Is it whatever?
And it depends how much work you're

319
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
interested in doing and how
complete the study is you want to do.

320
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
Either way, we could end up with a
collection of arginine auxotrophs.

321
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
Organisms that are mutant for the
ability to make their own arginine

322
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
and require it to be supplied
to them in the medium.

323
00:25:40 --> 00:25:45
All right. I might get,
depending on how much work I'm

324
00:25:45 --> 00:25:50
willing to do, dozens
of independent colonies

325
00:25:50 --> 00:25:55
unable to grow without arginine.
I might get hundreds if I'm willing

326
00:25:55 --> 00:26:00
to do enough work. I can
get as many as I want.

327
00:26:00 --> 00:26:08
Our goal now is to study them and
find out why they're unable to do

328
00:26:08 --> 00:26:17
that. I have a quick question?
Those yeast cells we plated, where

329
00:26:17 --> 00:26:25
they haploid or diploid?
We didn't say, did we? So,

330
00:26:25 --> 00:26:33
should they be haploid or
diploid? How many vote diploid?

331
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
How many vote haploid? A lot
of people vote haploid but

332
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
aren't willing to express
a reason why. Why haploid?

333
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
Right. Excellent. Excellent,
although genes are not

334
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
recessive, but OK. A little
detail. Phenotypes are

335
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
recessive. Tell me a
little more of what you're

336
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
thinking about. We'll
have it out later on this

337
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
point, yes. So, suppose we
were looking in a haploid.

338
00:27:12 --> 00:27:17
I take your point, even if
on nomenclature I want to

339
00:27:17 --> 00:27:22
push back a bit. So,
suppose it's a diploid and

340
00:27:22 --> 00:27:27
suppose we have now two
copies of this chromosome here

341
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
in the diploid. And suppose
there's a gene over here

342
00:27:32 --> 00:27:36
that encodes an enzyme that we
now is necessary to make arginine,

343
00:27:36 --> 00:27:41
or that somebody knows is
necessary to make arginine.

344
00:27:41 --> 00:27:46
Let's image that that's the case.
In order to get haploid yeast that

345
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
is unable to make arginine
due to a mutation in this gene,

346
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
you need to have some kind
of a mutation in this copy.

347
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
What about in the diploid yeast?
In order to make this yeast unable

348
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
to grow without arginine, do we
need a mutation in both copies?

349
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
Well, the answer is probably.
The truth is actually a bit more

350
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
complicated, but let's suppose it
was the case that even one copy of

351
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
the functional gene was sufficient
to carry out the enzymatic step,

352
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
then the answer would be yeah,
we'd need a mutation of both copies.

353
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
What's the chance of finding a
yeast that has a mutation in both

354
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
copies? It's obviously much less
than the chance of finding a yeast

355
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
that had a mutation of one
copy. So, we're much better to go

356
00:28:33 --> 00:28:37
searching in the haploid where the
phenotype will be revealed much more

357
00:28:37 --> 00:28:41
easily by virtue of just the single
mutation rather than having to,

358
00:28:41 --> 00:28:45
by chance, encounter one that
had mutations in both copies.

359
00:28:45 --> 00:28:50
Now, the reason I'm a little
bit cautious here is because

360
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
notwithstanding the textbooks,
it's not always the case that

361
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
everything like this is a
recessive trait. It's possible that

362
00:28:58 --> 00:29:03
auxotrophy for arginine
could be a dominant trait.

363
00:29:03 --> 00:29:06
So, how could that be?
Well, auxotrophy could be a

364
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
recessive trait. Suppose
there's some enzymatic

365
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
pathway, A goes to B goes to C goes
to D, and this encodes an enzyme

366
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
that carries out a
particular biochemical step.

367
00:29:16 --> 00:29:19
Well, if the gene is broken, if
the gene is missing, if the gene

368
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
doesn't make the protein, as
you guys all know that that's

369
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
what happens, then you don't have
the enzyme, you can't do the pathway.

370
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
And it is usually the case that
having just one copy is sufficient.

371
00:29:29 --> 00:29:32
Because having a little bit of
enzyme the pathway may work slower

372
00:29:32 --> 00:29:35
but it will still work just fine and
you'll eventually get arginine made.

373
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
But it's occasionally possible,
I note since you guys are

374
00:29:39 --> 00:29:42
sophisticated, that
sometimes a gene can encode a

375
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
protein which not only doesn't
work but screws up the other working

376
00:29:46 --> 00:29:49
copies of the protein. Suppose
the enzyme that did this

377
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
were a tetramer. It had
several subunits that had

378
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
come together. A mutant
copy of an enzyme,

379
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
when it forms into a tetramer,
might somehow disrupt all the other

380
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
good copies that are around.
And that does happen sometimes.

381
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
It can happen that you're going to
have an inability to make your own

382
00:30:14 --> 00:30:20
arginine be a dominantly inherited
trait. So, you actually have to

383
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
test whether it's recessive
or dominant. Often it will be

384
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
recessive. So, usually
most of these simple

385
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37
auxotrophs are recessive traits.
Occasionally some are dominant.

386
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
So, now, suppose we get a whole
collection of Arg auxotrophs,

387
00:30:43 --> 00:30:49
and we'll just give them a name.
I don't know. Here's my collection.

388
00:30:49 --> 00:30:54
We'll call the first one,
for lack of anything terribly

389
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
creative, Arg 1, Arg
2, Arg 3, et cetera,

390
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
each being an individual strain from
growing up originally for a single

391
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
colony that is unable to
produce its own arginine.

392
00:31:12 --> 00:31:17
We now want to take this
collection and characterize it.

393
00:31:17 --> 00:31:22
How many distinct genes does this
affect? Are these mutants perhaps

394
00:31:22 --> 00:31:28
all in the same gene? Are
they in a hundred different

395
00:31:28 --> 00:31:32
genes? How could we
tell? Now, of course,

396
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
if you're a biochemist, you
already know the protein you can

397
00:31:36 --> 00:31:39
see and dah, dah, dah.
But, if you know the answer,

398
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
well, why are asking then, right?
A geneticist goes out to ask this

399
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
question because he or she wants to
know all the possible ways you can

400
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
disrupt the cell so it cannot
make arginine. And we don't know in

401
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
advance what those ways are, so
how are we going to be able to

402
00:31:53 --> 00:31:56
tell whether or not different
mutations affect the same gene,

403
00:31:56 --> 00:32:00
the same function in yeast?
It's an interesting question.

404
00:32:00 --> 00:32:10
Geneticists do a variety of tests.
The first test that a geneticist

405
00:32:10 --> 00:32:20
does to characterize a mutant is by
tests of recessivity or dominance,

406
00:32:20 --> 00:32:30
whichever way you
want to put it.

407
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
We want to take each mutant and test
whether it is recessive or dominant

408
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
as a phenotype,
whether the phenotype,

409
00:32:37 --> 00:32:40
the auxotrophy for arginine
is recessive or dominant.

410
00:32:40 --> 00:32:44
So, here's mutant number one,
the mutant cell carrying this

411
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
mutation here. Conceptually
it affects some gene.

412
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
I'm going to label it Arg 1. We
don't know where it is in the genome.

413
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
There are other chromosomes here
as well. Here's my mutant cell.

414
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
How am I going to find out whether
or not the auxotrophy for arginine

415
00:32:58 --> 00:33:03
is recessive or
dominant? Yup? With what?

416
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
Cross it with a haploid that is
a prototroph, or I could just say

417
00:33:09 --> 00:33:15
cross it with wild type,
right? Perfect. So, make a cross

418
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
here, very good, with
wild type plus there.

419
00:33:21 --> 00:33:27
How do I know it's plus there?
This is wild type. Wild type is

420
00:33:27 --> 00:33:32
defined as the normal form. And
so, because I said this is what

421
00:33:32 --> 00:33:37
we're using as wild type, it's
necessarily plus because we're

422
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
measuring mutations relative to wild
type. So, what happens when we get

423
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
here? We now, when we
cross we get a diploid,

424
00:33:47 --> 00:33:52
and Arg 1 plus. Now, how do we know
whether or not that phenotype was

425
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
recessive or dominant? Sorry?
It's what shows up when we

426
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
try to grow it. So,
when we cross it,

427
00:34:02 --> 00:34:07
what kind of plate should we grow
it on first? Should we grow it on

428
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
minimal or rich? We better
grow it on rich because

429
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
just in case it doesn't, it
can't make its own arginine,

430
00:34:17 --> 00:34:22
we better first let it grow and then
test it. So, let's grow it on rich

431
00:34:22 --> 00:34:27
medium. We'll cross these together,
grow it on rich medium. So, grow on

432
00:34:27 --> 00:34:32
rich, test on minimal. OK?
And we'll be able to check out

433
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
the phenotype as to whether or not
the phenotype is wild type or mutant.

434
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
All right. So,
we could do that.

435
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
And we'll test the first one and
the second one and third one and the

436
00:34:45 --> 00:34:50
fourth one. And,
for each of these,

437
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
we'll write down whether it's
recessive or a dominant auxotroph.

438
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59
Now, let me assume that all
the ones we're talking about are

439
00:34:59 --> 00:35:04
recessive phenotypes. Because
everything I'm about to say

440
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
is very much harder if it turned
out any of them were dominant.

441
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
So, we're going to assume.
Let's assume now, but it's not

442
00:35:16 --> 00:35:21
always the case, we'll
assume that the collection,

443
00:35:21 --> 00:35:27
maybe Arg 100, are all recessive
auxotrophies, the phenotype

444
00:35:27 --> 00:35:35
is recessive. Now, how do
I tell if they're in the

445
00:35:35 --> 00:35:45
same gene or not? So, now
I want to characterize my

446
00:35:45 --> 00:35:55
mutant by some other test that will
tell me whether or not Arg 1 and Arg

447
00:35:55 --> 00:36:03
2 are in the same gene.
Suppose Arg 1 and Arg 2 are in

448
00:36:03 --> 00:36:11
different genes. Cross
them. What will happen?

449
00:36:11 --> 00:36:19
Right. So, to repeat that, if I
cross together the two mutants and

450
00:36:19 --> 00:36:26
they're in different genes,
each will have at least, the each

451
00:36:26 --> 00:36:34
will be contributing a good copy,
a functional copy, a wild type copy

452
00:36:34 --> 00:36:40
of one of the genes. So,
let's walk this through.

453
00:36:40 --> 00:36:45
Interesting. Interesting. So,
suppose I take a situation where

454
00:36:45 --> 00:36:50
I've got Arg 1, a mutation
in a gene over here,

455
00:36:50 --> 00:36:55
on this chromosome, and on the other
chromosome I've got a wild type copy.

456
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
My Arg 1 mutant is
mutated in a gene here.

457
00:37:00 --> 00:37:07
I've got this other gene here,
which is normal. And I'm going to

458
00:37:07 --> 00:37:14
cross that now by the strain that
has a wild type copy here for this

459
00:37:14 --> 00:37:21
first gene, but it has a
mutation in the second gene.

460
00:37:21 --> 00:37:28
When I cross them together, I
now get me a diploid cell here,

461
00:37:28 --> 00:37:35
which is Arg 1, a mutation
there, plus there, plus copy

462
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
here, and Arg 2.
Will having one copy,

463
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
one working copy of this gene
be enough to make the enzyme?

464
00:37:47 --> 00:37:53
No? In other words, is the wild
type phenotype dominant to this

465
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
auxotrophy, or is the
auxotrophy attributable to this

466
00:37:59 --> 00:38:04
gene recessive? Yes. Why?
Because we assumed it.

467
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
Why did we assume it? So I
would be able to say this,

468
00:38:09 --> 00:38:14
right? OK. If it wasn't we'd be in
trouble. But by assuming that we're

469
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
working with a recessive phenotype,
then we know that this will be

470
00:38:19 --> 00:38:24
enough to save the yeast.
What about here? Enough to save

471
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
the yeast so it will
grow without arginine.

472
00:38:30 --> 00:38:38
By contrast, suppose it was
the case that this cell here,

473
00:38:38 --> 00:38:47
Arg 1, and suppose our other mutant
that we had isolated in our mutant

474
00:38:47 --> 00:38:56
hunt was a mutation Arg 2 in the
same gene. Suppose these were the

475
00:38:56 --> 00:39:05
same gene. When I cross them
together I now have a cell

476
00:39:05 --> 00:39:14
that is Arg 1, Arg
2. In other words,

477
00:39:14 --> 00:39:24
its genotype is Arg 1 over Arg 2,
name of mutation. And can it grow?

478
00:39:24 --> 00:39:34
No growth without arginine. By
contrast, the genotype here is Arg 1

479
00:39:34 --> 00:39:43
over plus, plus over Arg 2. I
could even write Arg 2 over plus,

480
00:39:43 --> 00:39:51
but I just did that to indicate
the chromosomes that they came from.

481
00:39:51 --> 00:39:59
All right. This is called a Test
of Complementation because these two

482
00:39:59 --> 00:40:07
genes are able to compliment
each other's defect.

483
00:40:07 --> 00:40:18
If two mutations compliment each
other's defect then they are in

484
00:40:18 --> 00:40:30
different genes. OK?
Boy, that's a noisy one.

485
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
So, we're able to make
a Complementation Table.

486
00:40:36 --> 00:40:43
Suppose I take a bunch of yeasts,
wild type, WT, mutant number one,

487
00:40:43 --> 00:40:49
mutant number two,
mutant number three,

488
00:40:49 --> 00:40:56
mutant number four. And suppose I
cross them with each other in all

489
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
pair-wise combinations. I've
assumed that all of these

490
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
arginine auxotrophs have
a recessive phenotype here.

491
00:41:07 --> 00:41:12
These are all my Arg mutants,
and I'm assuming that this is

492
00:41:12 --> 00:41:17
recessive. What happens when I
cross them and I test to see whether

493
00:41:17 --> 00:41:22
they can grow without arginine?
If I cross wild type by wild type,

494
00:41:22 --> 00:41:27
can it grow without arginine?
Yeah. Normal phenotype. So, plus is

495
00:41:27 --> 00:41:32
going to mean prototrophic.
Minus will mean auxotrophic for

496
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
arginine. What happens when I cross
wild type with mutant number one?

497
00:41:36 --> 00:41:41
It grows. Why? By assumption,
these were all recessive.

498
00:41:41 --> 00:41:46
I'm only testing recessive ones.
Two. Three. Four. When I cross

499
00:41:46 --> 00:41:50
in this direction,
wild type by these guys.

500
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
This is going to be a
symmetric matrix, of course,

501
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
right? OK. Now, what happens when
I cross mutant one by mutant one?

502
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
I now have a diploid. Will
it be able to grow without

503
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
arginine? No. Why not?
It has no working copies

504
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
of that gene, so I'm going to put
a minus there. What about mutant two

505
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
with mutant two? Minus.
What about mutant three

506
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
with mutant three? Minus.
What about mutant four with

507
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
mutant four? Minus. Now,
what happens when I cross

508
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
mutant one by mutant two? It
depends. It might be plus or

509
00:42:28 --> 00:42:32
might be minus. If
they're in the same gene,

510
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
minus. Different genes, could
be plus. So, here's some data.

511
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
So, all this is compelled.
But the kind of data, ooh,

512
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
I'll use a color. Isn't that fun?
They want me to use colors over

513
00:42:49 --> 00:42:54
there. Here we go. Suppose
the data were minus,

514
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
minus, plus, plus, plus, plus,
minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,

515
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
plus. What
would it be?

516
00:43:06 --> 00:43:13
What conclusion could we draw?
Is mutant one and mutant three in

517
00:43:13 --> 00:43:20
the same gene? They
compliment each other?

518
00:43:20 --> 00:43:27
No. But is one in the same
gene as two? Yes. In fact,

519
00:43:27 --> 00:43:34
this box and this box here
define the genes beautifully.

520
00:43:34 --> 00:43:37
The groups that failed to compliment
define mutations in the same gene.

521
00:43:37 --> 00:43:41
These are called Complementation
Groups because they don't compliment,

522
00:43:41 --> 00:43:45
OK? It's a little complicated
but that's all right.

523
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
These are called Complementation
Groups because all the members of

524
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
the complementation group,
namely Arg 1 and Arg 2, failed to

525
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
compliment each other. They
could be called failure to

526
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
compliment groups, but
it would be too long.

527
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
OK? So, there you go. You
can take hundreds of mutants

528
00:44:04 --> 00:44:09
and organize them into
complementation groups and thereby

529
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
know which ones go to the same
gene. And now, if I want to study the

530
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
genes, I only have to study the
distinct complementation groups.

531
00:44:18 --> 00:44:23
Last thing, which we'll just have
time to do, are what's called tests

532
00:44:23 --> 00:44:28
of epistasis. We'll probably run
just a moment or two over on this.

533
00:44:28 --> 00:44:34
Suppose a biochemist were
collaborating with a geneticist and

534
00:44:34 --> 00:44:40
had studied what he or she thought
was the pathway for making arginine.

535
00:44:40 --> 00:44:47
Some precursor alpha
goes to precursor beta,

536
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
goes to precursor gamma,
goes to arginine. And suppose

537
00:44:53 --> 00:45:00
specific genes were needed
to encode specific proteins.

538
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
I'll call them Arg A, Arg B,
Arg C to catalyze each step

539
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
of this biochemical reaction.
The geneticist and the biochemist

540
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
could collaborate with each other
to study whether these mutants,

541
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
these particular genes now
that had been identified,

542
00:45:20 --> 00:45:26
affected each step of the pathway.
And here's how they might do it.

543
00:45:26 --> 00:45:30
They might take wild type yeast,
mutant, well, they wouldn't know in

544
00:45:30 --> 00:45:34
advance whether or not it was
missing the ability to grow on each

545
00:45:34 --> 00:45:38
of, whether it was missing
each of these enzymes,

546
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
but let's think conceptually.
Suppose we had a mutant that was,

547
00:45:42 --> 00:45:46
a strain that was wild type,
Arg A minus, Arg B, minus,

548
00:45:46 --> 00:45:50
Arg C minus, unable to make
this enzyme, this enzyme,

549
00:45:50 --> 00:45:54
this enzyme. And suppose we helped
it along. Suppose we gave the

550
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58
mutant arginine. Suppose
we supplement and grow it

551
00:45:58 --> 00:46:02
on media with arginine. Which
ones will be able to grow with

552
00:46:02 --> 00:46:08
arginine? Can wild type
grow if it's given arginine?

553
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
What about Arg A minus? B
minus? C minus? What if instead

554
00:46:13 --> 00:46:19
we offer it precursor gamma?
Will wild type be able to grow if

555
00:46:19 --> 00:46:24
it's given precursor gamma?
Sure. What about Arg A minus?

556
00:46:24 --> 00:46:30
No, because it still
is stuck at this step.

557
00:46:30 --> 00:46:35
It cannot. What about Arg B minus?
What about Arg C minus? Really?

558
00:46:35 --> 00:46:41
It hasn't got this enzyme.
What's it going to do with gamma?

559
00:46:41 --> 00:46:47
It ain't got anything to
do with gamma, no enzyme.

560
00:46:47 --> 00:46:53
Suppose I gave it beta. Wild
type, can it grow? What about

561
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
Arg A minus? No, because it
can go from alpha to beta,

562
00:46:59 --> 00:47:04
but it can't go to
gamma. It cannot grow.

563
00:47:04 --> 00:47:10
What about Arg B minus? I've
given it beta, but it can't do

564
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
anything with beta because
it hasn't got this gene.

565
00:47:16 --> 00:47:21
What about Arg C minus? Wait
a second. What did I just do?

566
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
We're just backward. Sorry.
If we gave it gamma, I just

567
00:47:27 --> 00:47:32
got lost here. If we gave
it gamma it was able to

568
00:47:32 --> 00:47:36
grow, well, we are completely
wrong, guys. It's able to grow here.

569
00:47:36 --> 00:47:40
Thank you. Let's go back on that.
You should have caught me before.

570
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
My mistake. If we have it gamma
it's able to, if it's a mutant here

571
00:47:44 --> 00:47:48
it can grow because it bypasses this
problem. And having gamma is enough.

572
00:47:48 --> 00:47:52
If I gave it beta, sorry,
if I gave it gamma and its

573
00:47:52 --> 00:47:57
mutation was here
it can grow. Sorry.

574
00:47:57 --> 00:48:02
Now, if I gave it here beta,
and its mutation was here, it can

575
00:48:02 --> 00:48:07
still grow, right? But
if its mutation is here it

576
00:48:07 --> 00:48:12
can't and if its mutation is
here it can't. That's better.

577
00:48:12 --> 00:48:17
I was getting worried there for
a while myself. Suppose I gave it

578
00:48:17 --> 00:48:22
alpha. Wild type can grow. If
I give this guy alpha, will that

579
00:48:22 --> 00:48:27
help if he's mutant in A? No.
Can it help if he's mutant in

580
00:48:27 --> 00:48:32
B? No. Can it help
if he's mutant in C?

581
00:48:32 --> 00:48:37
No. Sorry. There we go. I
usually start at the other end of

582
00:48:37 --> 00:48:42
this picture. So, what you
can see is these mutants

583
00:48:42 --> 00:48:47
have different phenotypes with
respect to being able to supplement

584
00:48:47 --> 00:48:52
them with different chemicals.
Now, let me ask in our last two

585
00:48:52 --> 00:48:57
minutes, I'll run two minutes over
here. Suppose I gave you a mutant

586
00:48:57 --> 00:49:03
that was a double homozygote.
Suppose it was Arg B minus,

587
00:49:03 --> 00:49:09
Arg B minus, sorry, Arg B minus
and Arg C minus. Suppose it was a

588
00:49:09 --> 00:49:16
double mutant, it lacked
both this and this.

589
00:49:16 --> 00:49:23
Which line of my table would it
resemble? Would it look like the

590
00:49:23 --> 00:49:30
first line, the second line
or the third line of my table?

591
00:49:30 --> 00:49:36
Second line. Why's that? If
I'm lacking B, I'm already in

592
00:49:36 --> 00:49:42
trouble here. And also
lacking C doesn't matter.

593
00:49:42 --> 00:49:49
So, I will look, just
like a mutant who lacks B.

594
00:49:49 --> 00:49:55
So, in other words, I'm able,
if I know something about the

595
00:49:55 --> 00:50:02
biochemistry of a pathway and I can
break my arginine mutants up into

596
00:50:02 --> 00:50:08
different kinds of phenotypes here
by their response to different steps

597
00:50:08 --> 00:50:15
in a pathway, I can then look
at combinations of mutants.

598
00:50:15 --> 00:50:20
And I can say if I have a double
mutant missing both B and C,

599
00:50:20 --> 00:50:25
does it look like B or does it
look C when I put them together?

600
00:50:25 --> 00:50:31
And it turns out that if it looks
like B then B was further upstream

601
00:50:31 --> 00:50:36
in the pathway. So, it
turns out that geneticists

602
00:50:36 --> 00:50:40
and biochemists can collaborate
based on the phenotype of the

603
00:50:40 --> 00:50:45
organism sometimes to infer
aspects of the biochemical pathway.

604
00:50:45 --> 00:50:49
These are the kinds of things
a geneticist does to be able to

605
00:50:49 --> 00:50:54
characterize mutants on a mutant
hunt. Next time what I want to do

606
00:50:54 --> 00:50:58
is talk about characterizing mutants
in a very different kind of organism,

607
00:50:58 --> 51:03
namely the
human being.
