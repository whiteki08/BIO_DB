8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,130
ERIC LANDER: Let's talk about
what Mendel really did in his

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,323
experiments.

10
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:32,680
So section one, Mendel's
experiments.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,900
Mendel did a lot of really
cool things.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,940
The first thing he did was, in
order to study heredity, that

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,730
was his assignment as a monk--
go study heredity--

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,150
he had to get some material
to work with.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,230
He decided to use peas.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,526
Why peas?

17
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:52,700
Well, there are a lot of
varieties of peas in the

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,350
market, many different
kinds of peas.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,980
And you could breed
them together.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,110
There were tall peas, short
peas, green peas, yellow peas,

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,580
round peas, wrinkled peas, all
kinds of peas that you could

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,500
find in the market.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,510
They grew very well
in the garden.

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,990
And when you're done with the
experiment, you could feed

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,340
them to the monks.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,330
So the first thing he did
was he got his material.

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,490
And did he immediately start
crossing his peas together?

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:16,780
No.

29
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,370
What did he do?

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,695
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

31
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:23,625
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

32
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,335
AUDIENCE: He grew
them separately.

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,160
ERIC LANDER: He first grew
them separately.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,370
Because he wanted to see if he
was going to study how traits

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,580
were inherited, he first had to
do the control experiment.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,860
He first had to show that if he
took each variety of peas,

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,790
they would breed true.

38
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,160
So the first thing is,
Mendel did controls.

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,210
That's an important thing
we learned from Mendel.

40
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,130
He took round peas.

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,820
He took wrinkled peas.

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,100
And he bred them with
themselves.

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,390
And they always came
out round.

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,950
And he took wrinkled peas and he
bred them with themselves.

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,380
And they came out wrinkled.

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,750
And if they hadn't always come
out round or hadn't always

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,760
come out wrinkled, it would've
been a much harder experiment

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,670
to interpret later.

49
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,800
So that was incredibly important
thing to do, was do

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,090
the controls, round
and wrinkled.

51
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,270
Then, when he was satisfied that
he had pure breeding or

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,670
true breeding plants, then and
only then did he do an

53
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,920
experiment.

54
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,060
What experiment did he do?

55
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,620
You all know Mendel.

56
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,700
The truth is, this is not
like a surprise here.

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,802
So what did he do?

58
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,450
He crossed the round
and the wrinkled.

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm trying to draw out the new
things here, but some of the

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,770
old ones you know.

61
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,000
And when he crossed round
and wrinkled--

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,780
We'll call this the
F 0 generation.

63
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,630
In the F 1 generation,
what did he see?

64
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:03,010
Round.

65
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,200
You all know this.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,850
He saw all round.

67
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,590
He didn't see puckered,
slightly puckered or

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,260
anything like that.

69
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,840
He didn't see any wrinkles.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,740
They were all every bit as round
as the rounds in the

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,720
parental generation.

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,770
That was an extremely important
point, because of

73
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,750
course, a competing theory of
inheritance was blending

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,450
inheritance, where the
offspring would be

75
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,250
intermediates.

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,950
And the truth is almost every
experiment that you do when

77
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,680
you take plants and you cross
them, or animals and you cross

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,350
them, despite your biology
textbook, shows blending

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,930
inheritance.

80
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,870
A tall plant and a short
plant, you breed them.

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,490
Almost always is
a middle plant.

82
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,420
But not for the peas.

83
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,400
The peas were a beautiful
system.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,650
And Mendel very lucky to have
chosen it, because truth is,

85
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,810
there was only one gene
difference that was

86
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,790
controlling these traits.

87
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,080
If there'd been 10 genes
controlling this, you'd get

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,820
some blending, blah,
blah, blah.

89
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,720
But Mendel got a situation
with really clean

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,510
experimental data.

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,970
The round was every
bit as round.

92
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,545
And so that said, no blending.

93
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,980
Now what did he do?

94
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,140
Next, what Mendel does is he
crosses these round peas to

95
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,959
themselves.

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,640
He selfs them.

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,770
So we're going to
self the peas.

98
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,180
The peas can be selfed.

99
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,580
They have both male and female
reproductive parts.

100
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,210
And when he selfs them,
they self pollinate.

101
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,190
And what do they produce?

102
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,440
Peas.

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,190
That's good.

104
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,440
They produce peas.

105
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,000
And what does he notice?

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,530
He notices that now they're
not all round.

107
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,530
Some of them are wrinkled.

108
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,340
And the wrinkleds are every
bit as wrinkled as the

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,420
wrinkleds were in the parental
generation F 0.

110
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,310
And the round were every
bit as round.

111
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,590
So suddenly wrinkled
had gone away.

112
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,240
And what had happened?

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,490
Sorry.

114
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,380
Wrinkled had gone away
in this generation.

115
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,190
And now it had reappeared.

116
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,735
The trait reappears.

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,950
It's quantal.

118
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,200
It's discrete.

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,180
It's not blended
out in any way.

120
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,040
It's not blended.

121
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,090
It's not imperfect.

122
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,115
It's the same wrinkled that
was there before.

123
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,760
That's a big qualitative
observation.

124
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,030
This whole blending notion can't
be right, at least for

125
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,530
this experiment.

126
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,920
Discreteness rules.

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,270
So that was his experiment.

128
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,800
Mendel could've written it up
and said, wow, the traits

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,920
don't blend.

130
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,920
They're discrete.

131
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,530
But Mendel, being an MIT kind
of monk, went further.

132
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,780
What did he do?

133
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,130
Sorry?

134
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,520
AUDIENCE: He repeated it.

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,360
ERIC LANDER: He repeated it.

136
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,770
And it still showed
some rounds and

137
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,850
wrinkleds and all that.

138
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,830
But he was a very quantitative
MIT monk.

139
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,960
He counted them, which seems
obvious, but ain't so obvious.

140
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,790
He counted them.

141
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,040
And what did he find?

142
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,360
A fixed proportion?

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,560
What?

144
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,326
AUDIENCE: A ratio.

145
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,041
ERIC LANDER: A ratio.

146
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,805
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there 1:3?

147
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:43,180
ERIC LANDER: 1:3 or 3:1 or
something like that?

148
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,650
No.

149
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,170
No.

150
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,550
Nope.

151
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,320
No, he counted.

152
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,170
He counted.

153
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:00,500
And what he found was
rounds: 5,474.

154
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,310
Wrinkleds: 1,850.

155
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,350
Ratio, not 3:1 at all.

156
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,010
2.96:1.

157
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,360
No, no, no.

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,980
But you see, you say because
your books all tell you 3:1,

159
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,120
that it's obvious if you
do that, you say,

160
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
that must be 3:1.

161
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,570
It not must be 3:1.

162
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,770
It's 2.96:1.

163
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,200
And if you do it again,
you might get 2.87:1.

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,210
And it actually takes quite an
imagination to say, it's

165
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,070
trying to be 3.

166
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,290
Just think about it.

167
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,670
You come to this experiment
and you say, it's

168
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,890
trying to be 3.

169
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,240
That's a separate leap and
an important leap.

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,320
He counted.

171
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,200
And he got numbers, 2.96:1.

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,740
And he got other numbers.

173
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,930
He then, as you've done so
quickly, made a hypothesis.

174
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:04,350
That hypothesis was that, in
fact, this was trying to be

175
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,180
3:1, that it quote "wanted to
be 3:1." It was near 3:1.

176
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,050
And that really the reason
it was trying

177
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,260
to be 3:1 was because--

178
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,220
Well, there was a pretty
nice explanation here.

179
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,900
His cool explanation was, the
round plants and the wrinkled

180
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,130
plants, well he made
up a model.

181
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,810
These guys had two particles of
inheritance, big R big R,

182
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,820
little r little r.

183
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,010
When you cross them together,
these guys were

184
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,530
big R, little r.

185
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,820
And when you self them, if you
randomly chose one particle

186
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,310
from the sperm and one particle
from the egg, ovule,

187
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,910
you would have big R, big R, big
R, little r, little r, big

188
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,970
R, and little r, little r,
all as possibilities.

189
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,050
And that these guys, big R, big
R, they would be round.

190
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,890
Why would they be round?

191
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,130
Well because that's what the
parental generation here was.

192
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,710
The little r little r, they
would be wrinkled.

193
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,230
Because that's the parental
generation there.

194
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,530
And these guys that have one of
each, what would they be?

195
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,240
Round, because we saw that in
the F1 generation, one of each

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,260
makes it round.

197
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,345
So we had a model, a hypothesis,
a model.

198
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,190
Pretty cool.

199
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,480
You can come up with this
model by saying, the

200
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,840
contribution from the male,
the contribution from the

201
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,550
female, this is the male
gametes, the female gametes.

202
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,350
You get this nice little thing
sometimes referred to as a

203
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,080
Punnett square.

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,670
Although he didn't use
Punnett squares.

205
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,120
And Punnett wasn't born yet.

206
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,360
Now what do you do?

207
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Mendel went out and got
experimental material.

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,490
He did controls.

209
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,090
He did an experiment.

210
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,200
He counted.

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,380
He then made this creative leap
to say, I see something

212
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,710
cool going on.

213
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,290
Integers are what's going on.

214
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,110
And made up a model.

215
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,440
What does a scientist
do at that point?

216
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,500
Sorry?

217
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,950
Oh come on.

218
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,940
In this modern world, if you got
a result this cool, what

219
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,620
would you be doing?

220
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:45,930
Sorry?

221
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,646
AUDIENCE: Publish it.

222
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,930
ERIC LANDER: Publish it right?

223
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,410
You're going to get out there
quickly and publish it.

224
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,760
Mendel whips off an email to
Nature in London, saying--

225
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
Or whatever the 1865 emails.

226
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,390
Actually it wasn't Nature.

227
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,220
It gets published in the
Proceedings of the Royal

228
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,710
Society of Brun.

229
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,790
But forgive me.

230
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,440
I'll use Nature, OK.

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,590
So he whips off an email to
Nature, which is what we do

232
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,600
today, telling the editor, we
have this really cool result.

233
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
I think it'll be of
broad interest to

234
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,620
the readers of Nature.

235
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,380
We're going to try to send
you a paper next week,

236
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,860
et cetera, et cetera.

237
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,650
Are you interested?

238
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,240
They write back, oh yeah.

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,780
We'd love to see your
paper Gregor.

240
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,840
And Mendel whips together
a paper.

241
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,102
What happens when Mendel whips
together this paper and it

242
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,990
goes off to London, to Nature,
the offices of Nature?

243
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,976
What does Nature do with it?

244
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:39,930
They just set it and type
and say, here it is?

245
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,920
What's the scientific process?

246
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,670
Peer review.

247
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,525
Before you go print this thing,
you've got to send it

248
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:49,710
out to some other scientists
as anonymous reviewers and

249
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,220
say, we've received this paper,
this correspondence

250
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,990
from Brother Mendel
in Moravia.

251
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,960
Would you review it for the
journal Nature and tell us

252
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,980
your candid opinion?

253
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,290
And they write it up.

254
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,510
And they send it
back to Nature.

255
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,860
And Nature makes a decision
whether to publish the paper.

256
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,110
So you're the reviewers.

257
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,380
Should we publish
Mendel's paper?

258
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,990
Who says yes?

259
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,910
Who says no?

260
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,392
Why no?

261
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:30,766
AUDIENCE: He needs
more examples.

262
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:31,880
ERIC LANDER: Needs
more examples.

263
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,710
So you're right.

264
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,020
One lousy trait.

265
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,060
Mendel actually had seven
traits in the paper.

266
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,730
It turns out I didn't tell you
them all, green and yellow,

267
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,650
and tall and short.

268
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,750
And they're all in the paper.

269
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,810
He actually has seven separate
examples that

270
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,020
show the same thing.

271
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,170
Should we publish it?

272
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,770
Why not?

273
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,280
It's just peas.

274
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,860
Oh boy, you're churlish there.

275
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,010
I mean, come on.

276
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,220
It's peas.

277
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,150
People eat a lot of peas.

278
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,210
It's a result.

279
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,920
It'll get others in the
scientific community

280
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,312
interested.

281
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,630
AUDIENCE: Who are the
peer reviewers?

282
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,300
ERIC LANDER: You.

283
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
I've assigned you as
peer reviewers.

284
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm asking you, should we
publish this thing?

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,700
We got seven traits we're
going to publish.

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,340
And it's pretty cool.

287
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,705
Nobody's ever reported this
3:1 ratio in this model.

288
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,310
AUDIENCE: That's true.

289
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,850
But I wasn't the peer
reviewer back then.

290
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,633
ERIC LANDER: You are now.

291
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,620
AUDIENCE: Then yes, I
would publish it.

292
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,210
ERIC LANDER: You'd publish it.

293
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,405
OK.

294
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,210
He'd publish it.

295
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,360
Because nobody's
reported this.

296
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,990
It's pretty cool.

297
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,610
The model perfectly
fits the data.

298
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:22,990
Yes.

299
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,316
AUDIENCE: It's got to
make predictions.

300
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:27,230
ERIC LANDER: It's going
to make predictions.

301
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,598
But the model fits the data.

302
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:32,161
AUDIENCE: The model needs to
make predictions [INAUDIBLE]

303
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:32,394
data.

304
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,370
ERIC LANDER: Are you saying
that we made up the model

305
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,490
after we saw the data?

306
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,040
And that it's not a surprise
that the model fits the data?

307
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
Yeah, that's right, isn't it.

308
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,380
That's a real problem.

309
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,200
If you make up models after they
fit the data, they tend

310
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,450
to fit the data.

311
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,890
Well they do.

312
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,020
That's a real problem.

313
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,900
So the reviewers write back to
Mendel and say, Mendel-- this

314
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,465
isn't actually how it happened,
you understand.

315
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,210
But anyway, they write
back to Mendel.

316
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,850
They write back to the
journal Nature.

317
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,240
And they anonymously say, we
would like to see some

318
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,380
predictions of this model to
see if this is really true.

319
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,660
And Nature writes
back to Mendel.

320
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,300
And the email says, could
you just show us some

321
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,730
predictions from this?

322
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,310
So to help Mendel out, what
predictions can we make?

323
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,040
What surprising predictions
could you make for Mendel's

324
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,640
experiment?

325
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,790
Well, this experiment, round
by wrinkled, gives round,

326
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,030
gives some rounds and some
wrinkles, which we think are

327
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,750
big R, big R, big R, little
r little r, big R,

328
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,340
little r, little r.

329
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,840
And that this is big R, big R.
How could we prove something's

330
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,320
going on in this generation?

331
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,670
AUDIENCE: Self them.

332
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,000
ERIC LANDER: Self them.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,210
If we pick out a round
and self it,

334
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,460
what's going to happen?

335
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,340
Sorry?

336
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,116
AUDIENCE: It depends
on which round.

337
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,770
ERIC LANDER: So how do I know
which round to pick.

338
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,440
They all look the same.

339
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,112
AUDIENCE: You just
try all of them.

340
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,060
ERIC LANDER: Try all of them.

341
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,630
If I try to all of them,
what am I going to see?

342
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,540
AUDIENCE: You'll see some that
only produce rounds.

343
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,362
ERIC LANDER: Produce rounds.

344
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:13,120
About what fraction of them
will only produce rounds?

345
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,310
1/3.

346
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,460
And what fraction will produce
rounds and wrinkleds?

347
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,080
AUDIENCE: 2/3.

348
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,180
ERIC LANDER: 2/3.

349
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,110
We have a prediction.

350
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,010
Thank you.

351
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,885
The prediction is,
test the rounds.

352
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,280
And although we don't know which
are which, 1/3 of them

353
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:38,320
will give rise to only rounds,
whereas 2/3 of them will give

354
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,800
rise to our 3:1 ratio.

355
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,090
That is a non-obvious
prediction.

356
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,850
If this model weren't right,
it's very surprising if you

357
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,480
would have nailed
that prediction.

358
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,800
Nice.

359
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,420
What other predictions
can you make?

360
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,626
What other crosses could
you set up to test it?

361
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,896
AUDIENCE: Wrinkleds
by wrinkleds.

362
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,550
ERIC LANDER: The wrinkleds
by themselves

363
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,490
will only give wrinkles.

364
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,700
And that's true.

365
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,020
Bingo.

366
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,030
So we're doing well.

367
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,186
What else?

368
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,644
AUDIENCE: Wrinkleds
with rounds.

369
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,330
ERIC LANDER: Wrinkleds
with rounds.

370
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:17,080
So I could take these three
rounds here and I can cross

371
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,410
them to wrinkleds.

372
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,260
What'll happen here?

373
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,900
If this was rounds, rounds over
wrinkled, wrinkled, it's

374
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,090
going to give rise to what?

375
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,980
AUDIENCE: Rounds.

376
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,960
ERIC LANDER: All rounds.

377
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,436
But if this is round wrinkled,
what would it give rise to?

378
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:33,744
AUDIENCE: Half and half.

379
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,680
ERIC LANDER: 50:50.

380
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,890
Half and half.

381
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,095
Now we're cooking.

382
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:42,070
There are all these predictions
that start

383
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,750
dropping out, because your model
tells you things you

384
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,490
haven't yet seen.

385
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,670
Mendel writes back and says,
I did all the experiments.

386
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,890
I did what the referees
requested.

387
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,200
The referees get
the paper back.

388
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,370
They say, yes indeed, Mendel's
done the experiments.

389
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,510
We recommend publication.

390
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,060
Nature publishes it.

391
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,320
They put out a press release
and all that.

392
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,280
Mendel's on the evening news,
that kind of thing.

393
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,740
It didn't really happen
that way exactly.

394
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,130
But anyway, you get the point.

395
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,980
That's the process
of doing science.

396
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,150
It's a cool process.

397
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,530
And it's a back and forth.

398
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,869
And it's a process of convincing
people, and you

399
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,550
convince them by predictions.

400
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,089
And you can think of
the kinds of cool

401
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,680
predictions you could make.

402
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,780
And that's what's fun about
working in a lab, is making

403
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,900
those kind of predictions.

404
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,400
Now all right.

405
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,650
I need to give you a
few definitions.

406
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,940
A gene.

407
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,510
When I refer to a gene for the
moment, I mean a discrete

408
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,100
factor of inheritance, discrete
particle, factor of

409
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,380
inheritance, something
like that.

410
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,730
Because geneticists early on had
no idea what genes were.

411
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,965
You know perfectly well a
gene is a DNA sequence,

412
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,230
blah blah blah blah.

413
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,020
But it's useful to be
able to think about

414
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,580
a gene in the abstract.

415
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,260
It's the thing that controls a
particular inheritance of a

416
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,410
particular trait.

417
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,130
Variant forms of a gene,
alternative forms of a gene,

418
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,380
are called alleles.

419
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,570
When I write big R, little r,
they are alleles of the gene

420
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,590
for roundness.

421
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,500
Allele, from the Greek meaning
other or alternative.

422
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:47,690
When I write genotype, I mean
the combination of alleles

423
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,830
that an individual has.

424
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,350
Like when I write big R, big
R, that's a genotype.

425
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,770
Or big R, little
r, or little r,

426
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,440
little r, that's a genotype.

427
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,050
When I say the word phenotype,
what do I mean?

428
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,403
A trait, an appearance.

429
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,440
What are the traits under
discussion here?

430
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,690
Round and wrinkled.

431
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,400
Geneticists are like
mathematicians.

432
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,070
They're very precise
about their words.

433
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,130
Now comes the ones that people
always have trouble with,

434
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,080
dominant and recessive.

435
00:19:47,130 --> 00:20:08,146
Phenotype 1 is dominant to
phenotype 2 if the--

436
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,396
Oops, sorry.

437
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,870
I meant to add two words here.

438
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:23,450
Heterozygote, homozygote,
words you know as well.

439
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,740
Heterozygote, having
different alleles.

440
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,440
Homozygote, having
the same alleles.

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
Different, same alleles.

442
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,930
So a phenotype, phenotype 1 is
dominant to phenotype 2 if the

443
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:47,300
F1 heterozygote, the cross
between them, has phenotype 1.

444
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,100
Why did I write this in this
wacky mathematical way?

445
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,570
That says round is dominant to
wrinkled if when I cross round

446
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,110
to wrinkled, the offspring
are round.

447
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,870
So which is dominant,
round or wrinkled?

448
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,630
Which is dominant, big
R, or little r?

449
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,860
No.

450
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,060
Big R is an allele.

451
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,420
We said phenotypes are dominant,
not alleles.

452
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,230
We don't say big R is dominant
to little r.

453
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,940
We say round is dominant
to wrinkled.

454
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,300
Now this will bother
you greatly.

455
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,010
And it will bother about 95%
of my biology colleagues.

456
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,890
But geneticists who are careful
use the word dominant

457
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,200
and recessive to refer to
phenotypes, not alleles.

458
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,450
Why do I care?

459
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,950
I care because big R, as a
molecular allele, as a variant

460
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,200
of a gene, might end up
controlling three or five

461
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
different traits.

462
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,490
Some of the traits that big R
controls could be dominant.

463
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,240
Some of them could
be recessive.

464
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,390
Sickle cell anemia, there's
a sickle cell mutation.

465
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,210
Is that recessive or dominant?

466
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,750
Sickle cell anemia
is a recessive

467
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,400
trait, a recessive phenotype.

468
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,430
But sickle cell trait, the
tendency for blood cells to

469
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,240
sickle at low oxygen tension,
is a dominant phenotype.

470
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,740
The allele that causes sickle
cell anemia causes a recessive

471
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,600
trait, anemia, and a dominant
trait that can be measured in

472
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
heterzygotes.

473
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,150
You'll forget this.

474
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,400
Everyone will forget this.

475
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,830
But I've at least told you
once that alleles could

476
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,480
control multiple phenotypes
and do control multiple

477
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,870
phenotypes.

478
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,770
And that's why geneticists
obsess about using the words

479
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,330
recessive and dominant to refer
to the phenotype, not

480
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,980
the genotype.

481
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,920
I've made my plea.

482
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,880
Like all of my colleagues in
the biology department, you

483
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,520
will continue to misuse
the word.

484
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,600
But there's a better chance
you'll get it right because

485
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,460
I've made my little
stand here.

486
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,775
Recessive is the opposite
of this.

487
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,050
Good.

488
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,220
This is mostly to say,
geneticists try to think

489
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,950
carefully about their words.

490
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,240
Those are the definitions.

491
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,130
You should be able to use the
words gene, allele, genotype,

492
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,200
heterzygote, homozygote,
phenotype, dominant, recessive

493
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,450
in a good way.
