1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,540
PROFESSOR: So now I have this.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,066
And what I need to do is
I need to transform.

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:28,200
So I need to take E.coli
growing in a test tube.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,510
And I need to put into it a
whole collection of zillions

5
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,710
and zillions of plasmid
molecules, plasmid circles

6
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,070
that all have different
pieces of human DNA.

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,260
One of these things might
have ARG1, one ARG2,

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,630
one ARG3, et cetera.

9
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,680
Or if it's human DNA, one of
them your hemoglobin, one of

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,420
them your collagen, whatever.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,390
I have to throw the DNA on
top of the bacteria.

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,210
And then I need to come up with
some engineering trick to

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,570
make the bacteria take up this
DNA across their cell

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,630
membranes and use it.

15
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,460
Why should I be able to
persuade bacteria

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,656
to take up my DNA?

17
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:20,620
AUDIENCE: They do it anyway.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,570
PROFESSOR: They do it anyway.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,550
Remember, we said they
like to exchange DNA.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,710
That's kind of their
thing, right?

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,060
They pick up DNA from their
environment anyway.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,440
See, as usual, we haven't really
invented something.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,780
What we've done is we have
used the natural property

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,970
that's out there.

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,690
The natural properties, bacteria
like to slurp up DNA.

26
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,520
Now in fairness, some pretty
cool protocols were developed

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,050
that improve the ability
to do it.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,290
You treat the DNA,
a little nastily.

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,720
You give it certain ions.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
You heat shock it in
a certain way.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,420
And then it encourages it
to slurp up DNA better.

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,410
But the ability to slurp
up DNA was there

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,580
in the first place.

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,630
We couldn't have given it the
ability to slurp up DNA if it

35
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,200
wasn't there.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
But we can always goose it up,
improve it in certain ways.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,500
And there are great protocols
that were developed in order

38
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,510
to be able to increase the
efficiency of such

39
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,150
transformation.

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,670
So now we now have our E.coli.

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,800
Here's an E.coli.

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:32,160
Some of the E.coli have acquired
a plasmid containing

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,130
human DNA or maybe, if we
used yeast, yeast DNA.

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,890
Some of them have it, right?

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,550
Because it's kind of
a random process.

46
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,910
Some slurp it up,
some haven't.

47
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,240
So I might have, I don't know,
maybe one in 100 of my cells

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
will have slurped up DNA.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,500
But 99 in 100 won't have
slurped up DNA.

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,530
I want to plate these out on a
Petri plate and grow them up

51
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,710
into individual colonies.

52
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,000
But I would like it to be the
case, please, that the

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,750
individual colonies that grow up
are only the ones that got

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,190
my plasmid.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
I really don't want to see
all these guys who

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,210
didn't get my plasmid.

57
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,980
So what do I do?

58
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,630
Do I go in there with a
microscope and try to figure

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,528
out which ones got my
human DNA plasmid?

60
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,410
So I would love to plate it out
and only have the guys who

61
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,660
got my plasmid grow.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,030
How do I arrange that only
the guys who got my

63
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,280
plasmid will grow?

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,060
Sorry?

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,860
PROFESSOR: For something.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,160
I got to put in a gene into that
plasmid so that only the

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,530
guys who get that will grow.

69
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,086
Any ideas for what gene
might go in there?

70
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,746
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

72
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:59,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

73
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,420
PROFESSOR: How about a gene
conferring resistance to an

74
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,410
antibiotic.

75
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,270
And then what could I do?

76
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,520
Well, I could plate.

77
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,980
I'm going to select--

78
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,290
see this E.coli here,
it had my plasmid.

79
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,150
And it's going to have a
drug resistance gene.

80
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,080
And it will grow up.

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,565
This guy over here, he didn't
get a drug resistance gene.

82
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:30,360
He doesn't grow up.

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,780
The only ones who grow up
have a drug resistant--

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,950
wait a second.

85
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,617
Why doesn't this guy grow up?

86
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,090
AUDIENCE: You add the drug.

87
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,170
PROFESSOR: Oh, I got to add
the drug, good point.

88
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,110
So what I'm going to do is I
add my drug to the plate.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,960
I add my drug to the medium,
to the Petri plate here.

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,170
And now my Petri plate is say
a penicillin plate or a

91
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,740
streptomycin plate or a
ampicillin plate or a

92
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,150
kanamycin plate or whatever.

93
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,300
And then the only things that
could grow up are the ones

94
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,110
that have resistance to whatever
antibiotic I used.

95
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,580
So I grow them up
on that plate.

96
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,910
And they grew up just fine.

97
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,960
The ones who didn't get-- now
how did I get that antibiotic

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,238
gene into the plasmid?

99
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,890
It actually comes that way
in nature, sort of.

100
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,050
Now when I get good,
I can move them

101
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,430
around from one to another.

102
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,310
But nature thought
of it first.

103
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,630
Nature gave us something that
had an origin of replication

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,060
and an antibiotic
resistance gene.

105
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,840
And we could just add
things to it.

106
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,640
It had everything we needed.

107
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,390
It had the ability
to slurp up DNA.

108
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,730
It had the ability to confer a
new property on the cells like

109
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,370
resistance to antibiotics.

110
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,510
And when we're done, we
have a library here.

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:11,420
And we call this a library of
cells or colonies, each one of

112
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,040
which has a distinct piece of
human DNA, each one of which

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
has a different piece
of human DNA.

114
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:23,190
Let me stop and ask,
any questions?

115
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,040
This is like one of the coolest

116
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,830
new procedures invented.

117
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,830
Yes?

118
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,763
AUDIENCE: Is it possible that
the same E.coli takes in two

119
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:31,470
of the things?

120
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,750
PROFESSOR: Is it possible that
same E.coli takes in two?

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, turns out we do this at a
dilution in a way so that most

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,170
take up zero, some take up one,
and a couple take up two.

123
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,960
And what we say there
is, oh well.

124
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,990
It's not so common.

125
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,590
And we live with it.

126
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,158
What else?

127
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:58,152
AUDIENCE: You need to make sure
the bacteria that doesn't

128
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,650
already have a resistance
to it?

129
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,990
PROFESSOR: I better use a
bacteria that's not already

130
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,750
resistant to this antibiotic,
good point.

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,490
That's right.

132
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,040
And I can do that.

133
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,993
Yes?

134
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,965
AUDIENCE: When making those
vectors, how do you make sure

135
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,662
it only cuts once so you can put
one piece of human DNA and

136
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:14,895
it doesn't break apart?

137
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:20,790
PROFESSOR: Oh, so what if the
vector had five EcoR1 sites?

138
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,170
People have engineered them
to just have one.

139
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,500
In fact, what they've really
done now is they engineer them

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,260
so that within the vector
there's a little region,

141
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,370
called a polylinker, that has
many different sites for many

142
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,470
different restriction enzymes,
depending on which one you

143
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,170
might want to use.

144
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,130
And they're all right over
here in the same place.

145
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,670
And they go around and
they fix the vector.

146
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,730
So it doesn't have any
of the others.

147
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,740
You could, for example cut it
open and change the sequence a

148
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,040
little bit.

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,810
All these tools are
available to us.

150
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,510
And rather than you
having to do it,

151
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,590
they're all in the catalog.

152
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,300
The catalog has vectors that
have polylinkers, don't have

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,650
any other cut sites, et cetera.

154
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,132
Yes?

155
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,604
AUDIENCE: How do you isolate the
sequence you want if the

156
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,090
cutting sequence
is so frequent?

157
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,210
PROFESSOR: Oh, so you're
asking two questions.

158
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,290
One is you're asking how do I
find the particular thing I'm

159
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,390
looking for on the plate
amongst the millions of

160
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,080
colonies that might grow up?

161
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,320
Or are you asking if the
cutting sequence is so

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,770
frequent, how do I avoid cutting
in the middle of the

163
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,020
sequence I want?

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,945
AUDIENCE: Well both, I guess.

165
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:30,470
If you want to replicate human
genes, if you have a bunch of

166
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,905
DNA, how can you make
it so that you

167
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,830
isolate only that gene?

168
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,530
PROFESSOR: OK, so now there
are really two questions

169
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,120
you're asking.

170
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,220
They're both really
good questions.

171
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,530
One, I take my human DNA.

172
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,970
And let's say we're trying
to clone the gene for

173
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,680
beta-globin.

174
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,890
Beta-globin is a part
of hemoglobin.

175
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,280
It's one of the two proteins
in hemoglobin.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,710
And let's say the beta-globin
gene is a certain length.

177
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,820
And suppose the beta-globin
gene actually has several

178
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,070
EcoR1 sites.

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm going to chop it up
into multiple pieces.

180
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,250
That's bad, right?

181
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,370
That's step one bad.

182
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,620
How do I avoid that?

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,130
Sorry?

184
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,540
AUDIENCE: Paste it.

185
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,160
PROFESSOR: Paste it again.

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Oh no, once I cut it, all the
pieces of human DNA are

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,700
floating around.

188
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,090
How do I know what
to paste to what?

189
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,470
AUDIENCE: Methylate it.

190
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,630
PROFESSOR: Methylate it.

191
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,800
So first I could take
my human DNA.

192
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,470
And I could methylate it.

193
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,030
Then it won't get cut
up by the enzyme.

194
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,120
But what's the problem
with that?

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,640
None of it will get cut
up with the enzyme.

196
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,620
Suppose I did something that
was a compromise though.

197
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,890
Suppose I added a little
methylase and a little

198
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,180
restriction enzyme.

199
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,700
And the methylase went around
randomly and put some

200
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,020
methyl groups on.

201
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,640
Then these wouldn't get cut.

202
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,620
And sometimes it might
put on that.

203
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,010
And those wouldn't get cut.

204
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,260
And it would just
get cut here.

205
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,805
I would call such a thing
a partial digestion.

206
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,810
It can be done one
of two ways.

207
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,380
I could just add a little bit of
restriction enzyme and not

208
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,630
give it too long.

209
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,800
Or I could add a mixture of a
little restriction enzyme, a

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,730
little methylation enzyme,
and let them have at it.

211
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,540
And if I had the right balance,
I could cut on

212
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,730
average every second restriction
site or on average

213
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,880
every fourth restriction site.

214
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,970
Or if I use a different ratio,
every tenth restriction site.

215
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,382
So I actually can play a
stochastic, a probabilistic

216
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:05,490
game of cutting every second,
fourth, tenth site and

217
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,420
obviously get a mix.

218
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,250
I'll get a mixture of
different cuts.

219
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,450
But in terms of cutting in the
middle of my gene, I no longer

220
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,010
care because I can do
partial digestions.

221
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,130
Now that means that in my
library I might not just have

222
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,270
the Eco fragments.

223
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,820
But because I did a partial
digestion, I might have two

224
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,130
consecutive or five consecutive
Eco fragments, if

225
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,700
I've done a partial digestion.

226
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,860
But your question
still stands.

227
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,740
How do I find my right gene?

228
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,640
How do I figure out which
is the right gene?

229
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,430
So I've got this.

230
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,680
I've got my plate.

231
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,820
I've done this amazing
purification.

232
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,320
Every one of these guys has a
chunk of human DNA that might

233
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,090
be just one EcoR1 fragment.

234
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,430
Or if I happen to have done a
partial digestion, it might be

235
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,450
two EcoR1 fragments.

236
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:04,262
But it turns out that this
guy here is beta-globin.

237
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:05,970
How do I know?

238
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,050
I've purified beta-globin.

239
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,430
I get points, right?

240
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,070
I purified beta-globin.

241
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,930
Somewhere on my plate is a pure

242
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,520
beta-globin sitting there.

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,180
But the problem is I don't
know where it is.

244
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,890
How am I going to find it?

245
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,080
They all still look the same.

246
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,330
They look like bacteria.

247
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,791
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

248
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,864
PROFESSOR: To do what?

249
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:33,343
AUDIENCE: Well, in this case
find some way to determine

250
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:37,330
whether or not a certain certain
has beta-globin.

251
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,300
PROFESSOR: Whether a
certain colony--

252
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,500
AUDIENCE: Has beta-globin.

253
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,610
PROFESSOR: Has the beta-globin
gene in it.

254
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,330
So I somehow have to test each
colony to figure out whether

255
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,780
it's got the beta-globin
gene in it.

256
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,070
How do you propose to do that?

257
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,090
AUDIENCE: There's some
observation you can make.

258
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,605
PROFESSOR: Talk loud.

259
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,160
AUDIENCE: There's some
observation you can make.

260
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,910
PROFESSOR: And you make
that observation.

261
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,460
Right, so--

262
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm with you.

263
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,918
Yeah?

264
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,313
AUDIENCE: You basically
want some ribosomes

265
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,750
to create the proteins.

266
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,870
PROFESSOR: Oh, oh, oh, so maybe
I can make that thing

267
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,860
make beta-globin.

268
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,190
Oh, and then look
for the protein.

269
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,960
Problem with that is E.coli
doesn't read human

270
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,360
instructions.

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,030
So E.coli's polymerase
won't read.

272
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,960
But it's a great idea.

273
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,940
Maybe we can do that.

274
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,590
Any other ideas?

275
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,360
How are we going to
find our gene?

276
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,410
We've made a library.

277
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,100
We have a library.

278
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,790
It's a bigger library
than MIT.

279
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,630
It's got more volumes
than MIT.

280
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,980
How are we're going
to find our book?

281
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,820
AUDIENCE: Put it in a medium
without beta-globin.

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,932
PROFESSOR: Put a medium
without beta-globin.

283
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:40,900
AUDIENCE: See if it
grows or not.

284
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,390
PROFESSOR: See if it grows up.

285
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,700
E.coli couldn't care less
about beta-globin.

286
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,800
It doesn't need beta-globin.

287
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,060
And in addition, it won't
produce beta-globin because it

288
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,480
doesn't read the human
instructions.

289
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,960
All right, so we've gone
to all this trouble.

290
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,680
We've made a library with all
the possible books in the

291
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,380
human genome.

292
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,170
And we don't know how
to use the library.

293
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,190
Friday's lecture let us discuss

294
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,440
how to use the library.
