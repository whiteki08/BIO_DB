1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,480
PROFESSOR: Here is the game
plan for the next

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,180
two or three lectures.

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm going to start by talking
about the chemical forces that

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,070
are important for the structure
and function of

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,010
these biomolecules.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,800
And then I'm going to relate
them, as we go along, to how

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,920
these properties influence the
characteristics of these key

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,530
macromolecules.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:49,150
And in particular we'll be
talking about covalent bonds,

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:59,640
hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, a
force known as van der Waals

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,610
forces, and something that's not
really a force but it's a

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,170
characteristic that's very
important, particularly when

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,760
we think about proteins
and lipids, called

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,010
hydrophobicity--

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,400
literally "fear of water."

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,810
And then the order
of the molecules.

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,200
As we talk, I'll talk about
carbohydrates first.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,710
I'll try and get
to that today.

19
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:47,590
Then we'll talk about proteins,
nucleic acids, and

20
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,390
lipids, in that order.

21
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,170
As you'll see, these two will
be sufficient to understand

22
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,130
most of the characteristics
of carbohydrates.

23
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,630
Whereas we're going to need all
five of these to be able

24
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,890
to get an intelligent
understanding of

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,695
how proteins work.

26
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:08,789
Now, I'll caution you.

27
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,209
It's going to seem--

28
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,780
God, he's going to talk about
covalent bonds, as everybody

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,190
is rolling their eyes.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,530
I heard about covalent bonds
in grade one or something.

31
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,140
But the difference here is that
we're going to be looking

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,720
at some of these forces, some
of which you've been exposed

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,900
to already, but from a
biological perspective.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,770
And I hope if you kind of watch
that, you'll begin to

35
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,650
see that you're looking at
something that may be sort of

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,560
familiar to you.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,060
But you have to start thinking
about it in a different way

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,910
once you start thinking of what
are the implications of

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,510
the properties of these forces
and the way these molecules

40
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,110
behave for biology.

41
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,350
So, begin with the one that
everybody undoubtedly knows,

42
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:59,780
which are covalent bonds.

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,370
And this is the principal force

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,410
that holds atoms together.

45
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,220
And it's based on sharing
electrons.

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,130
And as I'll say, these are
very strong bonds.

47
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,720
And so in the simplest sort of
example, hydrogen atom has one

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,710
unpaired electron, a
carbon has four.

49
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:32,630
And so you can make
methane, CH4.

50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,840
And commonly in chemistry and
biology we use a line to

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,465
represent a pair of electrons.

52
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,570
So there's methane.

53
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,160
As I said, apart from you know
it burns, if you go out in a

54
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,790
swamp or in a beach and you
see bubbles, muddy bottom

55
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,980
coming up, those are bubbles of
methane made by methanogens

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,810
that are living in the anaerobic
layer underneath.

57
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,470
A cow has a special
fermentation,

58
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,720
digestion cavity inside.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,630
It's huge, called a rumen,
stuff sloshing around.

60
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,240
And it's full of archaea,
that are methanogens.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,329
And a cow makes about 400
liters of methane a day.

62
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,440
And Penny will tell you, it's
a very bad greenhouse gas.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,740
It's much more potent
than carbon dioxide.

64
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,710
And so the typical length of a
covalent bond is about 1.5 to

65
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,190
0.2 nanometers.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,830
And I hope you'll try and begin
to get a sense of the

67
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,180
links of some of these
things, too.

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:58,700
But the key point about this
is to break a carbon-carbon

69
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:06,550
bond needs 83 kilocalories
per mole.

70
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,000
So that's a lot of energy.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,950
At 25 degrees centigrade, if
you take, say, a typical

72
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:25,040
vibrational mode of a covalent
bond, the energy that it has

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,110
is about 0.6 kcals per mole.

74
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,020
So what that means is that
covalent bonds don't break on

75
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,510
their own under physiological
conditions.

76
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:51,680
They can bend, they can rotate,
and they can stretch.

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,590
So they're back and forth this
way, they can go this way,

78
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,420
this way, but they
don't break.

79
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:04,740
And so this sort of leads to
another topic that we'll talk

80
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,410
about, which is utterly key--

81
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,720
It's one of the secrets
of how life works--

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,740
are these protein molecules
that are known as enzymes.

83
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,890
And we'll also talk a little bit
about a similar thing made

84
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,210
of RNA called a ribozyme.

85
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:38,340
But what these are are
biological catalysts that

86
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:47,000
enable specific bonds-- and
this is important--

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:06,280
specific bonds to be broken or
formed under physiological

88
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,530
conditions.

89
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,910
And this part is so important.

90
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,850
If you're trying to work out
a chemical reaction, the

91
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,410
original process for taking
nitrogen gas and making

92
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,840
ammonia, the Haber process,
involved some very, very tough

93
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,260
molecule to break the bond of.

94
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,310
So just heat it up to 500
degrees and put in a catalyst.

95
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,810
But if you're a living
organism, you

96
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,990
don't have that option.

97
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,453
You have to continually make
and break bonds under the

98
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:43,160
conditions -- the very, very
narrow conditions where life

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,170
is possible.

100
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,710
If you go a little too high,
things like proteins unfold.

101
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,380
And then they don't work as
properly as machines anymore.

102
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,880
So we'll be talking more about
that as we go along.

103
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,590
There are different types
of covalent bonds.

104
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,700
And again, the first
part of this isn't

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,500
going to surprise you.

106
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,290
There are single bonds,
like this.

107
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:16,140
There are double bonds,
and triple.

108
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:19,716
Excuse me.

109
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,615
I'll just stay with carbon
for the moment.

110
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,030
The more electrons that are
shared, the stronger the bond.

111
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:39,260
And these two are referred to,
if it's a carbon compound, as

112
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,919
being unsaturated bonds, the
same term you hear when you

113
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,950
hear about unsaturated fats.

114
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,540
And what that means is a fat
with an unsaturation, that's

115
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,130
unsaturated, will have somewhere
in it a double bond,

116
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,640
or in some cases, many
double bonds.

117
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,390
However, there's another aspect
of this which might not

118
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,020
have been relevant to you, but
you'll see it becomes relevant

119
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,550
for thinking about proteins as
soon as the next lecture.

120
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:14,090
And that is, a single bond is
able to rotate this way.

121
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:22,190
These guys can't rotate.

122
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,330
And that, as you'll see, becomes
important in quite a

123
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,240
variety of situations.

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,540
But we'll run into a very
important example of that when

125
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,990
we're thinking about the very
backbone of all proteins, the

126
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,500
peptide bond, which is at the
heart of being a protein.

127
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,970
There are other molecules that
have more than one bond that

128
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,520
are important.

129
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,402
Oxygen is one.

130
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:50,020
And nitrogen, as I said, is a

131
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,195
particularly hard nut to crack.

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,400
Most organisms, as I said the
other day, are unable

133
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,590
to break this bond.

134
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,530
The only organisms that
have learned how

135
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,310
to do it are bacteria.

136
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,760
The vast majority of them use
one, single enzyme called

137
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,620
nitrogenase that evolved that's
a very complicated

138
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,070
enzyme and has very, very
stringent requirements and

139
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,070
needs a huge energy input.

140
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,580
But it is able to crack
this bond and get

141
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,800
it made into ammonia.

142
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,060
But it's an example of another
molecule that has a triple

143
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,538
bond in it.

144
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:32,090
Let's see, how are
we doing here?

145
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,950
Okay.

146
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:45,130
So another aspect of these
covalent bonds that you need

147
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,440
to think about has to
do with when you're

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,340
thinking about carbon.

149
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,240
And it's a property
called chirality.

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,120
And it comes from the fact that
carbon has four bonds but

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,600
they come out as
a tetrahedron.

152
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,220
So that doesn't matter in
the case of methane.

153
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,560
But I'm going to depict the
tetrahedron in this way, so

154
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,760
that this bond is coming --

155
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,930
these two are in the plane of
the board, this one's coming

156
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,030
out, that one's going back.

157
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,160
And let's just put on four
different substituents.

158
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:37,160
Now if I get the mirror image
of that, we will have--

159
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,820
these two molecules are called
optical isomers.

160
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,800
And if you sit down and play
with this, you will find you

161
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,290
can't convert one to the other
without actually physically

162
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,130
breaking a bond.

163
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,510
And this is really important,
one of the central concepts

164
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,400
that I hope you might remember
from this course because it

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,270
cuts across a lot of the stuff
talk we'll be talking about.

166
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:39,500
At a molecular level, much
of biology relies on the

167
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:50,350
interaction of complementary
3D surfaces.

168
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,720
We're actually very familiar
with this at a macro level in

169
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,610
our own lives.

170
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,070
Imagine you've just come back
from the party late on

171
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,815
Saturday night, you're
crossing the Mass.

172
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:09,590
Ave. Bridge, the wind is
howling, you're freezing.

173
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,365
But no problem, you've
got your gloves.

174
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:16,170
And you reach in your pocket and
you have two left gloves.

175
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,070
No matter what you do, you can't
get that right hand to

176
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,750
fit properly into the
left-handed glove.

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,125
One's a mirror image
of the other.

178
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,260
But we run into this problem
even in our own lives.

179
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,750
When you saw how that DNA
had fit right into a

180
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,450
groove in the protein.

181
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,635
If we had a mirror image of
the DNA or we had a mirror

182
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,430
image of the protein,
it wouldn't work.

183
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,790
This principle goes all the
way through biology.

184
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,580
There is another characteristic
of covalent

185
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:04,120
bonds that becomes
important again.

186
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,040
And that is how equally the
electrons are sharing.

187
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,740
So again, it goes back
to the sharing of

188
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,290
electrons, but with a twist.

189
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,930
If we have a carbon-carbon or
a carbon-hydrogen bond, it's

190
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,100
pretty much equal sharing.

191
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,710
And this is known as
a nonpolar bond.

192
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:41,725
But if you have a nitrogen or an
oxygen bond, it's unequal.

193
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,350
And these are known
as polar bonds.

194
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,740
And the term that's used to
describe this unequal sharing

195
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:08,210
of electrons is known as the
electronegativity of the atom.

196
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,240
It's basically a word that
means the greediness of a

197
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,790
particular atom for electrons.

198
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,490
So if you have an oxygen and a
hydrogen bond, although we

199
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,680
write it like that on the board
and you've undoubtedly

200
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,790
seen this for many years in
chemistry, in fact, the

201
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,780
electrons spend more time down
here than they spend up there.

202
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,450
So there's a little bit of a
negative charge on the oxygen

203
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,840
and a little bit of a plus
charge on the hydrogen.

204
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,030
That's usually represented by
a little delta to indicate

205
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,760
that this has a wee bit of
negative charge, that has a

206
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,270
wee bit of positive charge.

207
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,540
And a molecule that's
very important with

208
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,710
respect to this is water.

209
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,315
Because water, as you
know, is H2O.

210
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,390
But it's not symmetrical.

211
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,570
The angle here is
104.5 degrees.

212
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,210
And so the oxygen has a little
bit of a negative charge but

213
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,960
each of these has a little
bit of a plus charge.

214
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,550
Actually, water is 55 molar.

215
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,440
So it's a little dipole.

216
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,510
You've got 55 molar, these
little dipoles going on.

217
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,430
This property of
electronegativity and nonpolar

218
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:42,090
bonds then leads to the second
of the forces that we're going

219
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,680
to be talking about.

220
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,428
That's force number two.

221
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:56,210
And that's a hydrogen,
or H bond.

222
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:06,829
And this is a bond that's made
possible by a little bit of a

223
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,200
negative charge that's on
oxygen, or nitrogen, or a few

224
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,352
other molecules and a little
bit of a positive charge

225
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:21,270
that's due to the hydrogen
that's in a polar bond.

226
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:38,400
This is very important, as
you'll see, for proteins,

227
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:48,160
nucleic acids, and for
carbohydrates.

228
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,330
And it has a huge amount
to do with the

229
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,240
way that water behaves.

230
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,590
Because in that 55-molar water,
you'll have one water

231
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,830
molecule that's going
to be like this.

232
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,255
And there will be another water
molecule down here with

233
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,670
a little bit of a
negative charge.

234
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,880
And this a little bit of a plus
charge on this hydrogen

235
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,860
and a little bit of a negative
charge can form what's known

236
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,500
as a hydrogen bond
between them.

237
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,060
And what's especially important
about these hydrogen

238
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:40,270
bonds is they're about
1/20 the strength

239
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,110
of a covalent bond.

240
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,320
And that means that in a
distribution of molecules at

241
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,463
physiological temperatures,
there will be some guys up in

242
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,360
the -- the most energetic
molecules within the bunch

243
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,330
will have enough energy to
break hydrogen bonds.

244
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,830
But they're much easier to do.

245
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,430
And just to peer ahead, when we
talk about replicating DNA,

246
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,270
those two strands are held
together by hydrogen bonds.

247
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,860
So the backbones are really
solid, just like two strips of

248
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,870
Velcro or something.

249
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,490
But the hydrogen bonds hold the
two strands together, but

250
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,660
1/20 the strength.

251
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,960
So it's basically like molecular
Velcro between the

252
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,850
two strands of DNA.

253
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:28,500
And we'll see some more
examples of this.

254
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,943
Let's see if I can go
back to this and get

255
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:30,900
this thing to play.

256
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,730
This is static representation
just illustrating this.

257
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,580
But in fact, what happens,
water molecules are

258
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,160
continually changing partners.

259
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,770
So they're constantly making
shells, and cages, and so on.

260
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,430
And the next little movie is a
picosecond simulation of water

261
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,760
just at zero degrees.

262
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,250
And you can see how the
molecules are changing

263
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,440
partners, making little
shells and things.

264
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,490
And here's a picosecond
simulation of water at the

265
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,225
boiling temperature.

266
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,790
And what you can see from this
is every now and then, a

267
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,020
molecule like this one will get
enough energy to break out

268
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,010
of this constant sharing
of little

269
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:14,820
hydrogen bonds and escape.

270
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,870
And another thing, when we talk
about getting something

271
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,170
dissolved in water, this
is something we'll

272
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,940
have to think about.

273
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,800
Because if you try and dissolve
something in water,

274
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,270
like stir a lot of oil into
it, you know what happens.

275
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,510
You can stir like mad
and doesn't go in.

276
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,890
Part of the problem is if you
put something in the water,

277
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,210
it's going to have to break
these existing hydrogen bonds.

278
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,920
And that's an energy cost.

279
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
So in order to get something to
dissolve, you're going to

280
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,490
have to get the energy back.

281
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,630
And we'll be talking
about that.

282
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,800
But it's one of the fundamental
parts of water.

283
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,760
You're familiar with the
characteristics of water.

284
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,390
There's surface tension.

285
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,920
It's why trees can grow 300 feet
tall, because they've got

286
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,330
basically little nanotubes
and little capillaries.

287
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,620
And with this surface tension,
water, due to hydrogen bonds,

288
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,120
can go 300 feet up.

289
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,490
The water can go right up.

290
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,470
You've seen water bugs
walk around on water.

291
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,100
There's a particularly
interesting lizard in South

292
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,800
America, Central America called
the basilisk lizard

293
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,250
that's about 2 and
1/2 feet long.

294
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,530
It's able to run across
the top of the water.

295
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,900
It's actually called the
Jesus Christ lizard.

296
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,030
And it's able to do that
because of this surface

297
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,300
tension in the water.

298
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,160
In fact, when I finished my
Ph.D. Thesis, I went in a

299
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,610
competition for the theses.

300
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,490
And mine was something like, a
chemical enzymatic synthesis

301
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,310
of oligoribonucleotides.

302
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,870
And I was competing against a
guy who said why do lizards

303
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,280
run on water, and his entire
talk consisted of movies of

304
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,510
this thing running
across the water.

305
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,970
I thought I was toast, but I
actually won that prize.

306
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,090
But anyway, every time I
see this I remember it.

307
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,380
For example, when they go and
explore Mars or think about

308
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,350
planets, they're always looking
for water because it

309
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,300
has this very, very special set
of properties that are so

310
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,980
important for life.
