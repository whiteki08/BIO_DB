1
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:11,750
PROFESSOR: So let's begin with
trying to introduce you to

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,000
biochemistry.

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,900
So I'm going to be thinking
atoms and molecules for a

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,150
little bit.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,640
Let's begin by thinking about
the composition of a cell, so

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,250
that's the basic unit of life.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:47,860
It's about 60% hydrogen, 20%
oxygen, 12% carbon, 5%

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,070
nitrogen, and then there's
a bunch of other stuff--

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,741
phosphates, sulfur, magnesium,
manganese, et cetera.

10
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:02,680
But that's not very helpful
way of studying biology.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,740
It's interesting and is relevant
in some contexts, but

12
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,960
that's the atomic composition.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,120
If we look instead at the
molecular composition of a

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,610
cell, then things start
to get interesting.

15
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,790
Cells are about somewhere in
the ballpark of 80% water.

16
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,905
Water's going to be
very important--

17
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm going to be talking
about that.

18
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:41,740
But of the remainder, then about
50% is protein, about

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,430
15% are these molecules we call
nucleic acids, and that

20
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,410
means DNA and RNA, which most of
you have probably heard of.

21
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,150
We'll be talking about those
in great detail.

22
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,000
15% are carbohydrate--

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,950
and in fact, we will talk
about those today--

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,790
and about 10% fall in the
category of molecules known as

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,980
lipids, which we'll be talking
about in another day or two.

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,850
And then there's a bunch of
other things-- vitamins and

27
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,610
other things that happen, but
you can sort of see the big

28
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,990
classes of proteins that make
up most of a cell are

29
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,740
proteins, nucleic acids,
carbohydrates, and lipids.
