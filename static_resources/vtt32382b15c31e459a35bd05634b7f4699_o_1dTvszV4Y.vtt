00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.750
ERIC LANDER: Good morning.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.000
Good morning.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:27.330
So last time, we ran
into a problem.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.760
We had Mendel, my hero Mendel,
this MIT-like mathematical,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.200
physical monk, had developed
this gorgeous theory of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.500
particles of inheritance.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.330
He didn't use the
word "gene" yet.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.295
Gene doesn't get invented
for much longer.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.760
For every trait, you had
two such particles.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.922
You gave one to your
offspring.

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:56.300
Each of the parents gave
one to their offspring.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.000
And that's how each offspring
gets two of them.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.239
That choice of which of the
two alleles to transmit to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.790
your offspring is
a random draw.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.470
And that explains beautifully,
for example, the 3-to-1

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.130
segregation pattern
that Mendel saw--

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.590
gorgeous.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.620
We put that model, which was
an ex post facto model, a

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.200
model made after the data were
available, to a test.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100
You guys insisted we had to
test it before you would

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.280
publish it.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910
And it holds up pretty well,
making pretty surprising

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.000
predictions that you
would otherwise

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.730
not have ever expected.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.660
Like amongst that 3 to 1, the
threes are not all the same.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.430
Some of those round peas
were homozygous

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.060
for the big-R allele.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.910
And in selfing, they'll never
produce wrinkled peas.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.310
But 2/3 of those round peas
were heterozygous.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.070
And when you self them, you
get 1/4 wrinkled peas.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.170
So the wacky prediction that
1/3 of the rounds will give

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.050
rise to no wrinkleds, and 2/3
of the rounds will give rise

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.050
to 1/4 wrinkleds is a surprising
prediction and,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.570
therefore, something that bears
stating as a scientific

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.491
prediction.

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:20.820
And so all those kind of
predictions can emerge.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.040
Then we turned to the question
of two factors.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.180
I'm practicing using
our words here--

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.800
homozygous, heterozygous,
alleles, et cetera.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.130
We now turn to two traits,
two phenotypes.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.550
We have two phenotypes
segregating.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.270
We had round and wrinkled, and
we had green and yellow.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.390
And Mendel determined, rather
brilliantly, that they

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.890
segregated, were transmitted
independently of each other.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.850
There was no correlation between
which alleles you got

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.590
at round and which alleles
you got at wrinkled.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.450
That was pretty cool.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.480
Let's just go over that, because
there's a real tension

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:23.330
to be resolved because we have
Mendel's second law versus the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.580
chromosome theory.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.260
So Mendel's second law--

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.005
let's just go back to it-- in
the F0 generation, we had our

00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:50.030
round green peas, genotype big
R, big R, big G, big G. We had

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:59.370
our wrinkled yellow peas,
genotype little r, little r,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.430
little g, little g.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.420
We cross them together, we get
F1 double heterozygotes, big

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.120
R, little r, big G, little g.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.850
We then perform a back cross
or test cross to the doubly

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.170
homozygous parent with the two
recessive phenotypes--

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.280
we're practicing
our words here.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.680
And what do we get?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.030
Well, we get certain options.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290
As we said, the gametes that
emerge from this parent on the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.205
left could be of the
following types.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.590
The gametes from the
parent on the right

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.120
are all those alleles--

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.230
Are those the recessive
alleles?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.610
No.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.140
You'll forget this over time,
but just to make me

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.000
comfortable--

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.460
they're actually the alleles
associated with the recessive

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.280
phenotype that we're
talking about.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.830
Because you know-- but will
forget, I assure you, because

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.370
all my colleagues in the
biology department have

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.210
forgotten--

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.630
that they could also control
multiple other phenotypes,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.760
some of which could
be dominant.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.450
But that's OK.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.070
I forgive you in advance
that you'll call

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.590
them recessive alleles.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.520
Anyway, you get this.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.673
And then these should occur at
equal frequency of one to one

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:24.923
to one to one.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.871
All right.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:36.420
Now, we had the chromosome
theory.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.890
The chromosome theory, the
observation of the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.260
choreography of chromosomes
during meiosis--

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.730
chromosomes in meiosis--

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.980
looks like this.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.010
We have chromosomes lining
up in pairs.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.490
Now, I'm not drawing
it terribly well.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.220
But the two members of each
pair are of the same size.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.890
But this pair could be
bigger, and this

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.900
pair could be smaller.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.920
It looks like they're really
finding each other.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.620
These chromosomes are visibly
different in shape.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.450
And so maybe I'll make this guy
a little longer, just to

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.020
indicate that, that
it actually knows.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.390
Now an explanation, we said, for
how Mendel's second law of

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.330
independent assortment of two
different phenotypes could

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.665
occur is that, for
example - round.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.130
It could be that the gene for
roundness is located on

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.030
chromosome number one.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460
These are two copies of
chromosome one that have been

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.050
duplicated, each of which
has the big-R allele.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.930
Next to it, two copies of
chromosome one that have been

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.380
duplicated, each of them having
the little-r allele.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.920
Over here on chromosome
number two.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.760
let's say, lies the gene
for green or yellow.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:17.270
And in this picture here, the
big G's are on the two copies

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.210
of this chromosome number
two that are here.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.770
The little g's are on the two
copies of chromosome number

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.150
two that are here.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:34.300
When the cell undergoes meiosis
one, we get to the

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:48.480
situation where we have big G,
big G; little g, little g.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.650
We've got big R, big R;
little r, little r.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.520
Could it have been the case
that the big G was on the

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.566
right and the little
g was on the left?

00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:00.430
Yeah, of course.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.620
It's totally independent
which way.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.250
I happened to draw
it this way.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.010
But with probability 50%,
it's the other way.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.860
That's why they're independent
of each other.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.950
And then when it undergoes
meiosis two that looks just

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:19.100
like mitosis, we end up with
our four gametes here.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:41.390
Sorry, our four gametes with big
G, big G; little g, little

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:49.330
g; big R, big R; little
r, little r.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.950
And that accounts for the big G,
big G; big R, big G; little

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.690
r, little g gametes.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.600
And then when they went the
other way, the organism would

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.510
make a set of gametes that had
the other combination of big

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.610
R's with little g's.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.530
So that's perfectly fine.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.750
And because the second
chromosome is independently

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.030
ordered compared to the first
chromosome-- when they line up

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.220
at the midline, they
don't really care

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.390
which way they are--

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.960
that'll account for one
to one to one to one.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.210
It's so straightforward.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:40.190
But what happens if, instead,
both the roundness gene and

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.425
the greenness gene live on
the same chromosome?

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.390
We'll have little r,
little r there.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:56.060
We'll have big G, big G here;
little g, little g.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:02.150
And then when they split,
we'll end up with--

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.510
now, chromosome two has
nothing that we

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.500
care about on it.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.395
It has a lot of genes.

00:10:09.395 --> 00:10:12.050
In fact, there could be
chromosomes three, four, five.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.530
I'm just not drawing them.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.290
But we're really going
to focus on

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.450
chromosome number one here.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:26.520
And you'll notice that here on
chromosome one, the big G's or

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:34.760
the little g's are coupled,
physically coupled to each

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.150
other, the bigs with
the bigs and the

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.820
smalls with the smalls.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:46.490
So now the kind of gametes that
can emerge from this will

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.410
only be big R, big G type or--

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.800
big G type--

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.270
or they'll be little
r, little g type.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.980
We can't get the reverse
combination.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.220
We can't get bigs and littles.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:10.040
So this, because these are
independent of each other,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:19.840
will get us one to one
to one to one.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:27.170
These are the big, little,
and then these other

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.610
combinations like that.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:39.070
This will get us only, if we
look at the big R, big G;

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.230
little r, little g; big R,
little g; little r, big G;

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:49.730
will get us one to one
to zero to zero.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.490
Let's give a name to this type,
the big R's and the

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.920
little g's.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.200
Let's call that a recombinant
type, OK?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.760
I'm just going to use that
word for the moment.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.570
The recombinant types-- the
bigs and the littles, and

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.690
littles and the bigs--

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.350
we're not going to
see any of them.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.710
This is a very strong difference
between Mendel's

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.170
second law and the chromosome
theory.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.030
If the chromosome theory is
right, and these chromosomes

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:19.240
are physical entities that have
integrity, they can't

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.240
both be right.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.660
So that's a great thing in
science, when you have two

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.050
different models and they can't
both be right, because

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.210
you learn things then.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.740
You can test them.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.930
Now, Mendel tested this without
actually knowing the

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.400
chromosome theory.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.490
And he always got one to one
to one to one for the seven

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.740
traits he looked at.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.720
Was he just lucky that they
happened to lie on the seven

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.970
different chromosomes?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.040
Or is there some problem
with this

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.340
chromosome theory, or what?

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.235
It took a while.

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:59.220
And then, of course, everybody
forgot about Mendel from 1865

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.920
until the year 1900.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.210
In the year 1900, people begin
to rediscover Mendel.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.010
Cytology has come along.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:10.750
In January of the year 1900,
plant breeders start

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.000
rediscovering Mendel.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.210
Sorry.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.562
Thank you.

00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:20.250
I see already.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.670
Thank you.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.910
I could tell by the look on your
face that something must

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.480
be wrong there.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.030
Good.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.860
Plant breeders start
rediscovering Mendel.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:37.230
And in January of 1900, three
different groups say, you

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.710
know, we found these laws.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.230
And they're just like
Mendel's laws--

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.680
which now everybody starts
paying attention to.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.460
But plant breeding-- and people
tried to do mice, and

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.020
people tried to do rats.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.770
What turned out to be the
winner, the place to really

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.980
study genetics, was
the fruit fly.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.490
Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia
University decided, after he

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.610
was really frustrated wasting
years breeding mice and rats

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.930
that just took too long, around,
oh, I don't know, 1906

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.160
or something like that, began to
start breeding fruit flies.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.020
Fruit flies are the teeny little
flies that when you

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.660
open a banana or fruits
or other kinds of

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.220
things, you'll see them.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.250
And studying Drosophila gave us
the answer to this question

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.090
of what the problem is, how
can it be that either it's

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.930
independent or totally
dependent?

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.090
So we're going to talk about
Drosophila melanogaster, the

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:40.000
fruit fly, and the discovery
of recombination.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.670
So now, Morgan--

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.920
I'm going to now start using
fruit fly notation to give you

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.180
some practice with fruit
fly notation.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.380
We're not going to use big
G's and little g's.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.690
They like to refer to
the normal allele

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.120
and the mutant allele.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.980
The normally allele is plus.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.930
The mutant allele gets
some kind of a name.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:19.940
And so he had a female fly that
was normal and normal at

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.880
two different loci, two
different genes.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.330
I haven't told you what
the genes are.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:30.240
And the male fly had a
black-colored body-- black

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.230
across its whole body--

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.700
and its wings were
shriveled and,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.840
therefore, called vestigial.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:45.570
So the phenotype here is black
and vestigial, black body and

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.400
vestigial wings.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.620
And this wasn't the normal
appearance of a fly.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.330
So he took these females by
these males, and he crossed

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.270
them together.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.730
And he got an F1.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:05.600
And the F1 was black over
vestigial, plus over plus.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.050
And what was their phenotype?

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.720
Were they normal appearance,
which is kind of a

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.090
sandy-colored body
and normal wings?

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.820
Or were they this all black
body and vestigial wings?

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.940
Turns out they were normal.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.100
From that, what do we infer
about these two traits, black

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.780
body and vestigial wings?

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.150
They're recessive traits.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:37.030
So here, the phenotype was
normal appearance.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:42.950
So then he crosses them back,
doing a test cross.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.240
Let's say he'll take males here
and females here, but it

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.030
actually works either way.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.440
And what he does is just
like we did there.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.740
He could get gametes that
were black, vestigial.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.480
He could get gametes that were
black, plus; plus, vestigial;

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.970
or plus, plus.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.210
Those are the four possibilities
that come out.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.160
So when he does it--
let's keep score.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.488
I'm going to write them now--

00:17:12.488 --> 00:17:18.390
plus, plus; black, vestigial.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.245
And from the other parent,
you got this--

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:29.060
black, plus; black,
vestigial; plus,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.310
vestigial; black, vestigial.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.280
Those are the four
possibilities.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.460
And if this was just like
Mendel's traits, it would be

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.970
one to one to one to one.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.410
These were the parental
types that went in.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.400
Plus, plus went in.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.130
And black, vestigial went in.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.690
Those were the combinations
of traits here.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.490
These were new combinations.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.240
What he observed--

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.160
Let's see.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.610
If Mendel's right, it'll be
one to one to one to one .

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.510
If the chromosome theory's
right, it'll be one to one to

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.750
zero to zero.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.552
And who was right?

00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:04.450
STUDENT: No one.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.420
ERIC LANDER: No one.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:18.080
The answer was 965 to
944 to 206 to 185.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.540
Neither model was right.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.060
Neither model's right.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.180
The new combinations, the
recombinant combinations, the

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.490
non-parental combinations--

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.390
we can call these recombinant
combinations.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.540
These were recombinant.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.350
They recombined in some way.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.390
They were a new combination,
or they were the

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.820
non-parental types.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.290
We use both of those
words frequently--

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.990
were neither equal nor were
they completely absent.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.850
They occurred, but at
a lower frequency.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.950
What was the frequency?

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.060
Well, we could just add it up.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:19:04.630
The frequency of recombinant
types, of new types of were

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:22.920
different than the
parents', is 17%.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.280
What's going on?

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.770
Now, maybe this is some magic
number like the 3-to-1 ratio.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.820
And you should look at that 17%
and say, ah, this is some

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.840
constant of the universe, that
when you put in traits you get

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.650
17% percent of recombinant
types.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.490
But it takes a little judgment
to say, I don't think so.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.940
And he actually tried
other traits.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.410
And sometimes he got one
to one to one to one.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.780
But very often he got
some funny number--

00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:00.030
6%, 28%, 1%.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.090
There was some funny
business going on.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.340
What's going on?

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.110
Recombination.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.470
That's what's going
on is there is

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.290
recombination occurring.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.573
What do we mean by
recombination?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.510
Recombination is very important
stuff, by the way.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.740
At some point, I will tell
you that understanding

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.870
recombination was actually
the origin of the

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.770
Human Genome Project.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.210
And it traces back to
a good MIT story.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.430
But that will be for a little
later in the semester.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.010
So what do we think's
happening here?

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.560
I'm now going to draw a close-up
of that chromosome.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.640
And here's another chromosome,
the other pair.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:04.280
And what we think here might be
happening is that you might

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:16.380
have plus and black;
black and plus--

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.700
oh, sorry.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.920
Black, right?

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.316
Black, black; plus, plus.

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:24.990
This would be plus.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.760
This would be plus.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.970
This is the normal chromosome.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.230
This is plus.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:34.000
So this chromosome here
carries the pluses.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.880
This guy here carries those
alleles black and vestigial.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.780
Well, what happens, the idea
was that somehow these

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.810
chromosomes exchanged
material here.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.860
And the chromosome that was
plus, plus; plus, plus now

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:03.290
somehow acquires that bit,
and this chromosome

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.810
somehow gets that bit.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:19.510
And we end up instead with a
picture like this, where some

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.470
of this came from here.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:34.960
And those two loci, black and
vestigial, were separated from

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.350
each other such that the black
allele moves over to that

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.400
chromosome.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.200
Is that clear?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.300
That's the notion.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.510
Why did they think
this was true?

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.380
Well, it turns out that in fruit
flies, you can actually

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.250
look at eggs under
the microscope.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.860
And you can look at
the chromosomes.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.230
And if you take if you take
the cells, and you take a

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.010
cover slip, and you squash it
down with your finger, you can

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:02.180
actually see chromosomes lying
right over each other, making

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.250
little crosses like I drew
there, up there, called

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.650
chiasmata, which
means crosses.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.310
And so people said, see, in the
microscope, you can see

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.990
they're lying on top
of each other.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.540
Are you impressed by that
piece of evidence?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.140
No.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.640
You took the cover slip,
you squished it

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.470
down with your fingers.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.400
So they're lying on
top of each other?

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.450
Big deal.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.480
I'm not going to be impressed.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.890
And calling it chiasmata doesn't
make me any more

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.280
impressed, right?

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.430
Although it's always good to
call things Greek names,

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.850
because people think they're
more sophisticated if you call

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.920
them Greek names.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.490
But this was the notion
people had.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:46.600
And the frequency 17% would
indicate how often these

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.850
crossovers occur.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.750
But if I were in the situation
we talked about with Mendel,

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.460
and I wrote this up, and I said,
see, it's 17% sometimes,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.610
6% sometimes, 28% sometimes;
and when I look in the

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.440
microscope, they lie on top of
each other; therefore, it's

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.690
recombination--

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.310
There were actually other ideas
floating around too.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.580
Maybe it has something to do
with developmental biology.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.820
It was a puzzle.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.370
When you have a really deep
puzzle, the most important

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.890
thing in science is to
find a young person.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.960
Because young people come
without prejudice.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.580
They say, let me just
look at all of this.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.200
Stand back.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.610
I don't come with
any prejudice.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.310
So at MIT, what is the solution
when you have a

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.270
problem like this?

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.460
A UROP.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.840
You want a UROP.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.405
So even 1911, that was the
solution at Columbia.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.970
Thomas Hunt Morgan got a UROP.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.480
I'm serious.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.200
He was called Alfred
Sturtevant.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.950
Alfred Sturtevant was a
sophomore at Columbia.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.570
Everybody else was busy finding
this recombination

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.482
data, how often this recombined
with this, this

00:25:01.482 --> 00:25:02.780
with this, this with this.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.400
Sturtevant--

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.680
he's a sophomore--

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.050
he says, god, this stuff's
interesting!

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.690
Professor Morgan, could I
have all the data and

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.800
try to look at it?

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.760
Sturtevant took it home
and actually pulled an

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.810
all-nighter, blew off
his homework--

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.920
it actually says so in
his autobiography.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.660
He says, I blew off my homework
and pulled an

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.370
all-nighter--

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.140
essentially in those words, he
says. "To the detriment of my

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.140
undergraduate homework"
is the way he puts it.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:42.310
But in any case, genetic maps
and Sturtevant's all-nighter.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.970
What Sturtevant did
was the following.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:54.300
He said, how are we going to
prove the chromosome theory?

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.850
I like this idea that
recombination is about

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.950
distance on the chromosomes.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.960
I like the concept that
maybe 17% is how often

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.800
these things recombine.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.770
Why would things only recombine
1% of the time?

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.020
What would that mean?

00:26:14.092 --> 00:26:16.400
They've got to be pretty close
together so that a crossover

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.130
between them happens
not so often.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.660
And what if things
were far apart?

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.920
Well, it could be more likely.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.310
So he likes the idea
that recombination

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.175
frequency means distance.

00:26:29.175 --> 00:26:31.230
But how are you going
to prove that?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.290
It could mean a zillion
other things.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.090
It could mean biochemical
pathways,

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.930
developmental biology.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.610
How are you going to prove that
recombination frequency

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.810
means distance?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.500
You've got to make predictions,
right?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.680
The only to do it would be
to make predictions.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.960
So Sturtevant takes the data,
and he starts making

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.210
predictions.

00:26:58.982 --> 00:27:04.150
I think, says Sturtevant,
these things are alleles

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:09.020
living at genes with locations
on the chromosome--

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.480
black, vestigial.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.300
How often do black
and vestigial

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.350
recombine with each other?

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.940
What is the frequency
of recombinant

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.050
non-parental types?

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:26.360
17%.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.860
So Sturtevant goes through the
data and he says, what about

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.265
other crosses people
did in the lab?

00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:36.770
Well, it turns out people did
crosses with another mutant

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.730
that produces a funny eye color
called cinnabar, Cn.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.020
So cinnabar.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:55.010
It turns out that the
recombination frequency

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:07.310
between cinnabar to
vestigial was 8%.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:12.620
Vestigial, cinnabar,
8% recombination.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.640
If this chromosome business
is right, where

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.890
should I put cinnabar?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.160
Sorry?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.084
Where do you want it?

00:28:21.084 --> 00:28:21.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.920
ERIC LANDER: Somewhere
in between.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.570
You'd like me to
put that there.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.920
STUDENT: On the other side.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.420
ERIC LANDER: Oh, OK.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:28.940
Wait a second.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.361
On the other side.

00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:32.430
OK, which is it?

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.765
How many vote for the left?

00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:37.080
How many vote for the right?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.510
How many conscientious
abstainers are there?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.930
Do we know?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:42.850
STUDENT: No.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:43.180
ERIC LANDER: No.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.880
There are two possibilities.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:52.160
It could be 8% this way, or
it could be 8% that way.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.410
How are we going to know?

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.223
Yes?

00:28:55.223 --> 00:28:57.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.990
ERIC LANDER: Black.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.750
What if we knew the answer
between cinnabar and black?

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.340
That would constrain
the problem.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.040
Can you give me two predictions
for what the

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.282
answer might be?

00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:08.520
STUDENT: Either 9% or--

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.310
ERIC LANDER: Either 9% or 25%.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.430
So now we have a prediction.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.570
We don't know where
cinnabar is.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.580
But the answer could be that
black to vestigial should

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.990
either be about 9%--

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.660
that's what that
would be here--

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:32.140
or about 25%.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.390
The answer?

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.270
About 9%.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.430
That's what Sturtevant found.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.900
That's a prediction
and kind of cool.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.230
And you can imagine taking the
data home and it's probably 9

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.780
o'clock, and you've
now realized, wow,

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.320
freaky, it's 9%.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.430
So then he looked at the
mutation "lobe." Lobe was

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.440
another mutation.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.530
The lobe mutation showed 5%
recombination from vestigial.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.200
Where should we put it?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.230
Left or right, well, let's
make some predictions.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.220
Suppose it's over here.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.360
Will it be very close
to cinnabar?

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.025
Will it be closer to black?

00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:39.990
But what if it was over here?

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.890
Well, it would be further.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.940
So let's put lobe in.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.960
And suppose we know
that lob is 5%.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.665
Then what's the prediction
for black to lobe?

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.660
22%.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:09.090
Answer, according to the
notebooks, 21%, pretty close.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.550
You'd like it to
be exactly 22.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.020
But life doesn't always
turn out that way.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.760
21's pretty close to 22.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.150
What other predictions
could we make?

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.540
If this is cinnabar here, could
you give me a prediction

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.620
for cinnabar to lobe?

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.450
13%.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.540
Yep, that works.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.790
Curved wing.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:38.640
Recombination distance
from lobed, 3%.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.950
So now you have some
predictions.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.460
You have this prediction here.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.180
You predict 8%.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.250
Answer, about 8%.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:50.660
Over here you predict 16%.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.730
Answer, about 16%.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.100
Bingo.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.960
Sturtivant says, if
these genes--

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.670
we call them loci, often.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.610
I'll use the word locus
synonymous with gene.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.370
Locus means a place.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.820
And geneticists think about
genes as a place on a

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.540
chromosome.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.320
If these loci--

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.570
the plural of locus-- if these
loci were really arrayed along

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:21.760
a linear structure, then it
would have to be the case that

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.380
they would have certain
additive

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.750
relationships between them.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.810
And the chance that they would
have these additive

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.900
relationships if they weren't
part of a line is pretty

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.820
implausible.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:39.130
That's a real prediction, a very
remarkable prediction.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.420
And it holds up with the data.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.260
Sturtivant pulls the
all-nighter.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.090
By the time the sun comes up at
Columbia University-- this

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.700
is Morningside Heights--

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.360
he's got the whole
thing worked out.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.340
Yes, this chromosome theory
must be right.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.520
It fits beautifully
all of these data.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.760
Pretty cool.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.220
You are all authorized to blow
off your homework anytime you

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.032
make a discovery like that.

00:33:07.032 --> 00:33:08.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.030
That's a course rule.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.230
Any homework will
be forgiven for

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:17.080
discoveries of that magnitude.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.810
All right.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.060
Tell your TAs.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.770
So now, what does it
really tell us?

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:30.565
It tells us that if genes are
very close together, the

00:33:30.565 --> 00:33:35.730
recombination frequency, R
recombination frequency, or

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.260
RF, might be very little.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.660
They could be as low as almost
zero, which means you never

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.760
see a recombinant because
they're right

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.130
next to each other.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.800
Or it could be that they're
further apart.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.990
It might be 1%.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.950
It might be 10%.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.100
It could keep growing.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.250
It might be 30%.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:34:00.100
Suppose it's way, way, way,
way, way far away.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.360
What's the largest it
ever gets to be?

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.020
Well, if they were on different
chromosomes--

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.310
suppose there were totally
independent segregation,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.889
different chromosomes--

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:14.790
what would they be?

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:15.238
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:15.238 --> 00:34:17.982
ERIC LANDER: No, it's 50%
because remember, one to one

00:34:17.982 --> 00:34:19.969
to one to one says that
the recombinant--

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:21.090
well, actually, this is an
interesting question.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.000
Let's come to that 100.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.300
On different chromosomes, one
to one to one to one means

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.489
that it's 50%, half of them
are recombinant types.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.469
It turns out on the same
chromosome, as you get farther

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.730
and farther and farther, you
might say there's going to be

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.290
100% chance of a crossover.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.110
And you might say the
recombination frequency could

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.010
keep growing past 50%.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.380
It turns out it doesn't.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:49.150
The reason is that multiple
crossovers can happen.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.060
So mathematical interjection
here, if here's my gene and

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.760
here's my gene, there could
be one crossover.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.400
There could be two crossovers.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.110
There could be three
crossovers.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:09.620
And so in fact, it turns out, as
you get very far away, you

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.390
have to start paying attention
to the probabilities of double

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.680
crossovers and triple
crossovers.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.560
And so it turns out that it's
a Poisson process of the

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.240
number of crossovers that
occurs, give or take.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.490
And you see a recombination
if there's an odd number.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.470
And for that reason, it
never gets above 50%.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.680
So as the distance gets further
and further and

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.740
further, it goes from zero to
50, which is the same number

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.760
you get for separate
chromosomes.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.620
Otherwise, you might think that
if there was just one

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.540
crossover, it gets to 100%
probability of recombination.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.360
But it never does, because
there are doubles.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.960
And you can actually observe,
if you make a cross that has

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.560
three different genes
segregating in it, you can

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.380
actually see the double
crossover type.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.400
So you can see very nicely
that if you make a cross

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:03.650
involving black, cinnabar, and
vestigial over plus, plus,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.710
plus, you can see that cinnabar
is right in the

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.870
middle because this
recombination happens at a

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.930
pretty good frequency.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.430
This recombination happens at
a good frequency, giving you

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.860
plus, cinnabar, vestigial
or black, plus, plus.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.060
Sometimes you will get
that recombination.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.320
You'll get out gametes that are
black, plus, vestigial,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.280
but at a much lower frequency
because they take two

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.230
crossovers.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.490
What will be the probability
of seeing a

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.600
black, cinnabar, vestigial?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.940
Well, we said that this
one was about 9%, this

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.040
one was about 8%.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.980
What's the product of a 9%
chance and an 8% chance?

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.000
It's about a 1% chance, a little
less than a 1% chance.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.520
That how frequently you see
black, plus, vestigial.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.170
You can even predict the
probability of a double

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.160
crossover event by multiplying
the two events

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.660
that have to happen.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.940
So your bottom-line rules here
is that because of these

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.410
double crossovers our
recombination frequency can go

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:15.640
from zero to about 50%.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.910
This is independent
assortment.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:25.650
And it either occurs if you're
on different chromosomes or,

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.015
if you're very far away on the
same chromosome, they behave

00:37:29.015 --> 00:37:31.260
as if they're independent
of each other.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.570
Any questions about
any of that?

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.563
Yes?

00:37:34.563 --> 00:37:36.535
STUDENT: Why didn't Mendel
ever see recombination?

00:37:36.535 --> 00:37:38.470
ERIC LANDER: Why didn't Mendel
ever see recombination?

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.710
It turns out that with seven
chromosomes, and they're

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.380
biggish in length, he never
actually ran into two loci

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.150
that were close enough,
to notice it.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.170
That's why.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:52.320
Flies actually only have three
major chromosomes.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.440
There's a fourth, but it's
a puny little thing.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.440
And because they were much more
intensively collecting

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.810
mutations in Morgan's fly room,
they began having a lot

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.110
of them, and they
had to bump into

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.960
recombination pretty early.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.670
Mendel simply didn't have enough
that were close enough.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.770
Think about what would have
happened if just by chance,

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.790
somebody were selling a strain
of peas in the market which

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:19.310
had a mutation in a locus that
had 10% recombination

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.200
distance, and it screwed up
Mendel's law of independent

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.560
assortment of two loci?

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.720
Mendel might not have
published the paper.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.450
Sometimes in science it's
actually valuable to first get

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.520
the oversimplification out ,
like his second law, and then

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.650
deal with the complexity
that sits on top of the

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.030
oversimplification.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.810
It's kind of lucky that Mendel
didn't have enough of them to

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.620
be bothered, in the
first paper.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.680
So in fact, all of Mendel's
seven loci

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.440
have now been mapped.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.120
Most have been cloned
molecularly.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.470
And so we actually know where
they are, et cetera.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.790
It's a really good question.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.240
That's sort of why he didn't.
