1
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,290
ERIC LANDER: That worked.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,800
Let's do it again.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,970
Now, number 2.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,790
I would like to clone not the
Arg1 gene, but let's say the

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,020
beta globin gene from human.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,290
So let's take human
beta globin.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,070
I want to clone it.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,810
So human beta globin,
hemoglobin, it's a tetromer.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,530
It has four parts.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,070
It's got an alpha, an alpha,
a beta, and a beta.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,930
Four proteins come together
in a protein tetromer.

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,880
And it's got two alphas,
two betas.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,520
The beta subunit of hemoglobin
is encoded by the human beta

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,820
globin gene.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,245
That's the nomenclature here.

16
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,870
All right.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,120
Let's clone beta globin.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,670
Same deal.

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,709
How are we going to do it?

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,959
Any takers?

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,800
What should we start with?

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,210
Yes?

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,436
AUDIENCE: Find a restriction
enzyme?

24
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:14,080
ERIC LANDER: Find a restriction
enzyme.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,890
I'll go to catalogue and
try EcoRI today.

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,800
OK?

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,158
Now what?

28
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:25,078
AUDIENCE: Add it to a bunch
of [INAUDIBLE].

29
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,740
ERIC LANDER: So I'm going
to start with human DNA?

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,945
AUDIENCE: Yes.

31
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,380
ERIC LANDER: Yes is
a good answer.

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,050
Yes.

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,990
I'm going to start
with human DNA.

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,370
Good.

35
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,160
Let's get that up there.

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,780
We're going to start--

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

38
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,745
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

39
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:38,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,120
ERIC LANDER: So we'll start
with human DNA.

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,430
There we go, pieces of human
DNA cut with EcoRI.

42
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,680
Now, what are we going to do?

43
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,590
Takers?

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,590
Let's attach it to a vector.

45
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,560
Actually, wait a second.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,330
This vector here, I told you
that there were vectors that

47
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,707
could grow in E. coli.

48
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,930
Did I ever tell you there
were vectors that

49
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,180
could grow a yeast?

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,800
There are.

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,720
And they're in the catalog.

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,530
OK.

53
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes?

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,650
Now, what am I going to do?

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm going to attach
this to a vector.

56
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,900
Now, what do I do?

57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,490
What vector do I want
to attach this to?

58
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,490
Where is it going to grow?

59
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,740
Human cells.

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,550
That's interesting.

61
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,365
So one option would
be human cells.

62
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:47,340
So we want to take a vector
that grows in human cells.

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,590
Ha.

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,373
Yep.

65
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,623
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

66
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,790
ERIC LANDER: Then I need
a mammalian origin of

67
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,730
replication.

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

69
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,520
ERIC LANDER: And a mammal--

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,380
Well, so it turns out that I
can technically do this.

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,610
There are now vectors
that I can use to

72
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,340
grow in human cells.

73
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,820
It's a lot harder to do.

74
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,680
So let's try doing it with a
microbe first, but then we'll

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,950
come back and we'll
do it with human.

76
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,220
So try doing this
in a microbe.

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,050
What have you got
for a microbe?

78
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,300
How do we do this
in a microbe?

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,710
Well, let's try E. coli for
the sake of argument.

80
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,480
But we could also try, keep in
mind your human for a second.

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,450
We do this, we do this,
we get a plate.

82
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,070
One of these guys is going to
have alpha globin, one of them

83
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,500
will have collagen.

84
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,910
That guy here has beta globin.

85
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,770
How are we going to
recognize it?

86
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,020
This is tough.

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,490
What were you going to
do for the human?

88
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,194
AUDIENCE: No idea.

89
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,405
ERIC LANDER: But you were
going to get it

90
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,390
into a human cell.

91
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

92
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,680
ERIC LANDER: Were you going to
try to do complementation?

93
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,886
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

94
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:08,400
ERIC LANDER: Yeah.

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,440
The problem doing
complementation is most human

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,660
cells don't need beta globin.

97
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,900
What's beta globin good for?

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,375
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

99
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,472
ERIC LANDER: What's hemoglobin
good for?

100
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:18,316
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

101
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,790
ERIC LANDER: It's in your red
blood cells to transport

102
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,500
oxygen around.

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,940
You think individual
cells care?

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
Nah.

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,130
Your marrow might,
but only in C2.

106
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,680
The problem with doing it in a
human cell initially is, if we

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,920
tried the same exact trick
and we tried a beta

108
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,580
globin-deficient human cell,
and we're going to try to

109
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,810
complement with a beta globin,
the problem is we don't have

110
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,480
any conditions under which
that cell cares.

111
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,230
But we'll come back and even
do more because we could do

112
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,960
things here.

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,970
So now what are we
going to do?

114
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,950
How are we going to see where
our beta globin is?

115
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

116
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,800
ERIC LANDER: Make the protein.

117
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,100
So we're going to
persuade this E.

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,570
coli to make the protein.

119
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,271
And how are we going to
recognize the protein?

120
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,955
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

121
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:03,430
ERIC LANDER: So how can we
recognize a protein?

122
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,705
AUDIENCE: Function.

123
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,590
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

124
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,536
AUDIENCE: Function.

125
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,120
ERIC LANDER: Function.

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
The problem is we didn't really
have a function to

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,130
complement.

128
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,490
Electrophoresis.

129
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,110
We could actually take every
colony on the plate, grow it

130
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,760
up, purify the proteins, and
see if there was a protein

131
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,410
band at just the right place
for beta globin.

132
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,590
We'd have to look at about a
million colonies to do it.

133
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,550
Maybe a little more, actually
more because you know,

134
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,710
statistics and all, 10
million colonies.

135
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,640
And the issue there is graduate
students tend to, you

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,480
can check with the TAs, but on
the whole, tend to rebel at

137
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,530
the thought of prepping protein
from 10 million

138
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,030
separate cells.

139
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,780
How else can we tell if our
cells are making beta globin?

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,680
AUDIENCE: You add
a marker to it?

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,850
ERIC LANDER: Something that
sticks to beta globin.

142
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,480
Turns out that antibodies are
really good for this.

143
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,590
If you take beta globin and you
inject a mouse with beta

144
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,835
globin, it'll make an immune
reaction against it.

145
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,960
And we'll learn more about the
immune system in the course,

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,840
but it will actually make
antibodies that

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,540
bind to beta globin.

148
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,030
So suppose I told you there were
antibodies that actually

149
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,280
bind to beta globin?

150
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,900
Now, what can I do?

151
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,235
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

152
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,550
ERIC LANDER: I'll make it a
fluorescent antibody, sure.

153
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,780
You can have a fluorescent
antibody if you want.

154
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,320
Fluorescent antibody
that knows how to

155
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,780
bind to beta globin.

156
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,940
Now, how do I find my cell?

157
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,660
AUDIENCE: Colonies.

158
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,900
ERIC LANDER: Take my colonies.

159
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,410
Do what to them?

160
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,874
AUDIENCE: Add antibodies.

161
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:41,314
And look for the colony
that had antibodies--

162
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,630
ERIC LANDER: Stuck to it.

163
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,780
I just wash antibodies
over my colonies and

164
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,470
see where it sticks.

165
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,810
Now, the only details are this
is on an agar plate, and it's

166
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,520
really messy to do that.

167
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,010
So just technical details of
pulling that off are I

168
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,970
actually grew these on a little
piece of filter paper.

169
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,330
So I put a piece of
filter paper down.

170
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,490
I grow the colonies on filter
paper getting their little

171
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,680
nutrients through there.

172
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,350
I take off my piece of filter
paper that has my colonies

173
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,490
growing on it.

174
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,780
I need to crack open all of
those cells, and it turns out

175
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,200
I can do that by a chemical
treatment that will crack open

176
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,480
all the cells and leave
their protein

177
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
contents just spewed out.

178
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,570
They spew out their guts
right here, each cell.

179
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,190
And then I wash my antibody
over it, and my

180
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,550
fluorescently-labeled antibody
sticks to that guy telling me

181
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,090
that beta globin was
right there.

182
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,340
Any questions?

183
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,835
I did it.

184
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:39,085
You did it.

185
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,780
Except there's a problem.

186
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,568
What was your problem?

187
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:49,774
AUDIENCE: Is it possible that
the antibody won't stick?

188
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,330
ERIC LANDER: It's a wonderful
antibody.

189
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,665
It's a perfectly specific
antibody.

190
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:54,230
The antibody is totally
perfect.

191
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,480
It only sticks to beta globin.

192
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,010
Does the bacteria want
to make beta globin?

193
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,050
You're throwing this stuff in
and if any bacteria actually

194
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,210
did make you beta globin, this
would be working perfectly.

195
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,800
The little problem is, will a
piece of human DNA thrown into

196
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,890
E. coli make beta globin?

197
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,120
No.

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
Why not?

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,220
Well, let's go back to
our understanding

200
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,470
of how genes work.

201
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,210
The beta globin gene is a
locus that has a human

202
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:36,940
promoter which then goes
and makes a transcript.

203
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,809
That transcript has
multiple exons.

204
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,660
Those exons go into the
transcript and are spliced

205
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,490
together to make a
mature message.

206
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,830
Here is the mature message,
which gets translated.

207
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,480
We have splicing, and then
this gets translated.

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,070
The spliced product
gets translated.

209
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,280
And what's the problem asking
E. coli to do this?

210
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,106
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
do splicing.

211
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:07,010
ERIC LANDER: It doesn't
do splicing.

212
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,070
And in fact, if you told me
we'll use yeast instead, it

213
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,390
turns out yeast does a very
bad job in splicing human

214
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,220
introns also.

215
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,405
And E. coli doesn't recognize
human promoters.

216
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,740
So this doesn't work
very well.

217
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,480
Any takers on what we're
going to do about this?

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,630
How do we fix this problem?

219
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

220
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,350
ERIC LANDER: Ah.

221
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,420
So one solution would be teach
E. coli how to splice DNA.

222
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,030
That's hard.

223
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,930
Start with cDNA.

224
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,870
That's nice.

225
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:49,300
So let's take our messenger
RNA, mRNA, and let's now

226
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,920
convert it into cDNA.

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,170
What is cDNA?

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,920
cDNA remember, we can
copy RNA into DNA.

229
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,340
What enzyme copies
RNA into DNA?

230
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,090
We learned about it
when we studied

231
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,390
replication and all that.

232
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,510
AUDIENCE: Reverse
transcriptase.

233
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,750
ERIC LANDER: Reverse
transcriptase.

234
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,550
So if I can get my hands on some
reverse transcriptase, I

235
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,410
would be able to add reverse
transcriptase to mRNAs from a

236
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,240
human cell and make cDNA.

237
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,600
And where do I get reversed
transcriptase?

238
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,980
It's in the catalog.

239
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,880
So I now make cDNA and
instead, I put

240
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,000
the cDNA in the vector.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,380
I do this, of course,
for many, many,

242
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,600
many different RNAs.

243
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,900
I take total RNA from the human
cell, I convert all the

244
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,780
total RNA all at once into
different cDNAs.

245
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,720
Those different cDNAs get put
into the vector, and I now

246
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
have what's called
a cDNA library.

247
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
So now I have a cDNA library.

248
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,300
And now each of these guys has
not a piece of human genomic

249
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,110
DNA, but a piece of human cDNA
copied back from a message.

250
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,430
One of those guys
has beta globin.

251
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,240
Now will E. coli produce
beta globin?

252
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,280
No.

253
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
Because

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,946
AUDIENCE: Promoter.

255
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,940
ERIC LANDER: Promoter.

256
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,000
It doesn't have a promoter
that it recognizes.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,945
What are we going to do
we do about that?

258
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,590
AUDIENCE: Add one
in the vector.

259
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,540
ERIC LANDER: Add one
in the vector.

260
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,045
Give it a promoter
in the vector.

261
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:27,190
Good.

262
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,130
You guys are getting into
the engineering of this.

263
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,755
Let's say that the vector
has an E. coli promoter.

264
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,470
Now, each of these cells will
actually make that mRNA.

265
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,740
That mRNA is spliced,
and it will, in

266
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,160
fact, produce an mRNA.

267
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,570
The cell will translate it if
we do this right, and is the

268
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,810
genetic code the same
in E. coli in human?

269
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,260
Yup.

270
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,030
So we can actually make, you
could make beta globin.

271
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,070
Now, we wash over our antibody,
it recognizes which

272
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,800
cell is making beta globin,
and it sticks.

273
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,110
There's beta globin.

274
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,466
It works.

275
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:20,140
Oh, by the way, what have we
also just invented here?

276
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,430
We've invented a bacterial cell
that's able to produce a

277
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,050
human protein.

278
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,790
What if instead of beta
globin, we put in

279
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,790
the gene for insulin?

280
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,040
What would we have invented?

281
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,370
A way to produce insulin without
having to purify it

282
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,800
from the pancreases of animals,
which is how we used

283
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,590
to have to treat juvenile
diabetics.

284
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,130
But instead, if we put the
insulin gene in, and we have

285
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,000
an E. coli promoter, let's
say, in theory,

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,590
we can make us insulin.

287
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,050
And what would we
have invented?

288
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,570
The biotechnology industry.

289
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,110
That's basically the start to
the biotechnology industry.

290
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,790
One of the first things that
was done was cloning the

291
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,330
insulin gene to make
recombinantly-produced insulin

292
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,040
by just the method you
guys invented today.

293
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,330
It's just unfortunately others
invented them first, so you

294
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,930
don't get a patent on it or
anything, but all right.

295
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,590
So now we got two ways to clone
genes so far, and there

296
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,950
are a lot of ways
to clone genes.

297
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,770
I've given you two, later
in the course,

298
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,020
I'll give you a third.
