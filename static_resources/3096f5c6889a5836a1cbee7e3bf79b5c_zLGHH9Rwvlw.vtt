00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:11.750
PROFESSOR: So let's begin with
trying to introduce you to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.000
biochemistry.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.900
So I'm going to be thinking
atoms and molecules for a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150
little bit.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.640
Let's begin by thinking about
the composition of a cell, so

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.250
that's the basic unit of life.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.860
It's about 60% hydrogen, 20%
oxygen, 12% carbon, 5%

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.070
nitrogen, and then there's
a bunch of other stuff--

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.741
phosphates, sulfur, magnesium,
manganese, et cetera.

00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.680
But that's not very helpful
way of studying biology.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.740
It's interesting and is relevant
in some contexts, but

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.960
that's the atomic composition.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.120
If we look instead at the
molecular composition of a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.610
cell, then things start
to get interesting.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.790
Cells are about somewhere in
the ballpark of 80% water.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.905
Water's going to be
very important--

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:27.870
I'm going to be talking
about that.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:41.740
But of the remainder, then about
50% is protein, about

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.430
15% are these molecules we call
nucleic acids, and that

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.410
means DNA and RNA, which most of
you have probably heard of.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.150
We'll be talking about those
in great detail.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.000
15% are carbohydrate--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.950
and in fact, we will talk
about those today--

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.790
and about 10% fall in the
category of molecules known as

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.980
lipids, which we'll be talking
about in another day or two.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.850
And then there's a bunch of
other things-- vitamins and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.610
other things that happen, but
you can sort of see the big

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.990
classes of proteins that make
up most of a cell are

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.740
proteins, nucleic acids,
carbohydrates, and lipids.
