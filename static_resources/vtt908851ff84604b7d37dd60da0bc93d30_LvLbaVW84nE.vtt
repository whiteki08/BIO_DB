00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.610
PROFESSOR: Hello, and welcome
to a help session on

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.910
complementation.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.300
Today, we are going
to be working

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120
out a problem together.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.600
If you have not yet had a chance
to work out the problem

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.370
on your own, please do so now,
and then return to this video.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.790
All right, now that you've had
a chance to look at the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.850
problem your on, let's
work it out together.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.820
So, here we have a series of
different fruit flies.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.900
They all have these recessive
mini-fly phenotypes.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.460
So, we've noticed that
there are lots

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.140
of different mutations.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.870
And, now, we would like
to put them into

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.930
complementation groups.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.990
So, we start off by looking at
this nice, large Punnett

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.620
square we have, where all the
flies have been crossed to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200
each other.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.690
So, if we look at A and B for
instance, when these two flies

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.410
are crossed together,
they still

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.670
have a mini-fly phenotype.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.450
This means that the mutation is
in the same gene and that

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.300
these two mutants do not
complement each other, but

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.950
they make up one complementation
group.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.630
So if we look farther down this
column, A and F together

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.980
also have a mini-fly
phenotype.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.730
This means A, B, and F, all
three of these are in the same

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.980
complementation group.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.240
So, now that we've already
looked at A and B, let's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.800
continue on to C. So, C has a
normal fly in all of these

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.710
instances except this one.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
When C and E are crossed
together, they also have a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.430
mini-fly phenotype.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.920
Thus, C and E also form a
complementation group.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.946
So, now we're done with A,B, C,
E, and F. So looking at D,

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:21.600
D when crossed to all the other
flies, you never get a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.870
mini-fly phenotype.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.760
So, D must be in its own
complementation group.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.730
Great, so we've identified all
three complementation groups.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.910
So, moving on to the next
part of the problem.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.650
We are asked, are mutations B
and C in the same gene, or are

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.210
they in different genes?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.210
All right, so, if we look over
here at B and C together, when

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.740
these are crossed, we
get a normal fly.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.570
This means that the mutations
were able to

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.430
complement each other.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.130
Meaning that the two mutations
occur in different genes, and,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.500
thus, when you cross the
flies, they're able to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.590
compensate for each other.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.395
So, they're in different
genes.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.590
All right, now, in the last
part of the problem, we're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.260
told that we are introduced to
a new fly, or a new mutant

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.690
fly, G. When G is crossed
to A, we get a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.930
mini-fly phenotype out.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.900
Also, when we cross G to B, we
also get a mini-fly phenotype.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.300
So the question is, what
does this suggest to us

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.480
about mutant G?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.470
Looking over here, we notice
that A and B are in the same

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.890
complementation group.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.720
When A and B are crossed
together, we also get

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.690
mini-flies So, this suggests
to us that G is yet another

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.150
member of this complementation
group.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.510
Thus, G also falls into
complementation

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.280
group number one.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.460
This concludes our help problem
on complementation.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.710
