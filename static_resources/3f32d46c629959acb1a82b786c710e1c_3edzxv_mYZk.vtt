WEBVTT

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:12.960
HAZEL SIVE: All right.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.830
Let's move on to the second
topic of our discussion today,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.500
which we will start today and
then continue on Friday.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.580
And this is a discussion
of the proteins.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.970
The proteins, probably the
most fascinating class of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:46.180
macromolecules, 55% of the dry
mass of a cell, and proteins

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.320
function everywhere.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.835
They do almost everything.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.470
Strictly speaking, proteins
are not hereditary

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.910
information, although Professor
Jacks will talk with

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.670
you about a class of proteins
called prions, which kind of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.180
are hereditary information.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.810
So not hereditary info,
but they do

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.700
almost everything else.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.155
They form the structure
of the cell.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.520
They form a major class of
catalysts called enzymes that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.060
we will talk about on Friday.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.050
They function in defense as
in the immune system.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.040
They allow cells to move,
dot, dot, dot.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.580
Okay?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.650
We'll talk about proteins on and
on and on as major players

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.110
in the fabric of life.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:08.990
Their monomer is an amino
acid that is abbreviated

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.950
AA or little aa.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.360
And it has a particular
structure that forms around a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.060
central carbon, which is called
the alpha carbon.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.190
And from this alpha carbon,
there are four groups that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.220
emanate, something called R,
which is the functional

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.480
interesting group of
each amino acid.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:49.400
So R is characteristic of each
class of amino acid.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.150
We'll talk more about
this in a moment.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.920
And then we'll put in a hydrogen
and then there is a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.530
nitrogen or an amine group,
which I'm going to draw here

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.640
as NH3 positive.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.180
And the other group is a
carboxyl group, which I'm

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.050
going to draw here
again as ionized.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.270
So R, actually, I'm going to
give a special name to.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.970
We'll call it a side chain.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.620
And this side chain can
be a charged group.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.915
It can be polar or non-polar.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.810
And let me see what I have
as the first thing.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.200
Yes.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.130
Here are some of the side groups
in amino acids, for

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.750
example, lysine.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.190
Here is the alpha carbon, and
here's its side group.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.180
You can see it ends
in an amino group.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.870
It's positively charged.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.580
Glutamic acid, I keep forgetting
glutamic acid.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.590
This is a better screen.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.440
Glutamic acid ends.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.290
It's got a carboxyl
group at the end.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.155
It's negatively charged.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.680
It's an acid.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.940
Here's one, tyrosine with
a polar uncharged group.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.450
This benzene ring and the
hydroxyl gives some polarity

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.660
to the molecule and here's
leucine with a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.460
hydroxyl gives polarity.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.170
Leucine is non-polar.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160
It's really a hydrocarbon and
cystine has this interesting

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.760
very reactive sulfhydryl group
at the end of its R chain,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.860
which is capable of reacting
with another sulfhydryl group

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.680
and forming a disulfide bond.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.000
The polymer, actually I think
I could write it here, the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:53.190
polymer of amino acids looks
like this, and it's called a

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:03.230
peptide if it's less than 20
amino acids and a protein if

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.640
it's about more than
20 amino acids, but

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.700
that's kind of loose.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.400
You should know the term
peptide, polypeptide mean

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.440
something a bit bigger than a
peptide, protein, they're all

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.090
the same chemical structure --

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.880
just refers to differences
in the amount of

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.380
sequence in the polymer.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.490
How does the protein
polymer form?

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.340
I'll draw that for you now.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.050
And it forms by making a
particular bond called a

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.480
peptide bond that you should
know and be able to recognize.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.690
So let's draw amino acid
one with carbon.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:50.100
And we're going to put its amino
group, its hydrogren,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.040
and then its carboxyl group.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.430
And we're going to add to it.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.210
So this is going to be amino
acid one, and we're going to

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.915
add to it another one with
a second side chain.

00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:08.760
And here, we'll draw out the
hydrogens on the amino group.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.780
This oxygen and the hydrogens
on the amino group are going

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:29.840
to interact, and they are
going to undergo a

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.570
condensation reaction.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.820
And actually I realize when I
drew for you the nucleotide

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.050
condensation reaction, that
was when we drew the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.460
dinucleotide that was forming,
I realize I didn't put that

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.970
there was elimination of a
molecule as the dinucleotide

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.440
was forming.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.980
It's a bit complicated, and that
was why I didn't do it.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.100
But in this case, this is a kind
of classic condensation

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.950
reaction, which will eliminate
water, and you'll end up with

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.550
something that looks
like this.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.120
So here's your alpha.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.600
I'm going to circle the alpha
carbon so we don't

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.850
get where they are.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.680
And then we've got a carbonyl
group that's joined to an

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.910
amine and then the other
alpha carbon, R2.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.600
So here is amino acid
one, amino acid two.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.320
And here is a dipeptide,
or diamino acid.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.270
It doesn't really matter
what you call it.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:46.510
The peptide bond is this guy,
and it's a very, very

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.725
important bond.

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:53.410
It holds the protein chain
together, and you need to be

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.770
able to recognize it.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.690
Two other features of this
as well, which will be

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.890
reminiscent of the nucleic acid
case, and on one end --

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:03.890
the ends are different.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.380
Okay?

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.030
The ends are different.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:16.470
On one end, there is a free
amino group, and this is

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:24.930
called the amino end or the
N-terminal of the dipeptide or

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.580
of the protein.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:37.320
And on the other end, there is
a free carboxyl group, and

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:47.440
this is termed the carboxyl or
the carboxy, or the C-terminal

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.660
of this dipeptide, or indeed
of any protein.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.160
So this is going to sound
reminiscent of the case as in

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.460
nucleic acids because like
nucleic acids, proteins,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.990
because they have different
ends, have a linear order.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:15.980
So we'll write it again,
different ends

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.350
and a linear order.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.350
And again, it's this linear
order that can only be read in

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.040
one direction or that leads
to information that is not

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.250
symmetric or not randomly
oriented that gives the

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.530
protein its particular
properties.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.370
So let's write this out
again, formally.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.770
On one end, there's
the amino end.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.900
You can also write
this as NH2.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.590
It's done kind of casually.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.270
You can write it as N. Doesn't
really matter to us.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.710
And then here's your polymer
of amino acids.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.060
And here is your carboxy end.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.470
You can write COO.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.570
I always write COOH.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.460
You can also write C. All of
those are kind of given as

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:11.250
being equivalent and this is
your amino end and your

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.580
carboxy end.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.680
That's terminology, but you can
tell from where these free

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.720
chemical groups are which amino
acid was added first and

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.130
which was added last.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:29.060
And the amino acid nearest the
end terminal is added first.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.020
The one nearest the free carboxy
is the most recently

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.470
added, always added last.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.200
Now, we went through a bit of
a calculation for nucleic

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.180
acids where there are four
bases, and I pointed out to

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.200
you that you could get a lot of
combinatorics out of four

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.620
bases if you had a polymer
that was long enough.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.080
For proteins, the situation
is actually

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.810
dauntingly more complex.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.565
There are 20 different
amino acids.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:24.470
So for a peptide, that's three
amino acids, you would get 20

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:34.760
to the third combinations
or 8,000.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:45.060
Proteins can be greater than
1,000 amino acids in length.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.810
Proteins or peptides for little
ones can range from two

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.960
to greater than 1,000
amino acids.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.770
And so the number of
combinations of information

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.300
that you can get in proteins
is enormous, and that means

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.050
that most of protein space has
not been explored by life and

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.470
can be explored in
the laboratory.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.700
And that's very exciting in
thinking about the various

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.840
functions that one can find that
have not yet been found.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.870
Now, the thing that is different
about nucleic acids

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.670
and proteins apart from their
fundamental chemical

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.590
structure, is that nucleic
acids, as we will discuss, are

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.000
used as a linear more
or less, they are

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.930
read as a linear string.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.740
You start somewhere, and you
read along the nucleic acid,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.700
and you get your information
out, and that gives you some

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.830
kind of a next step.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.820
Proteins, although they have a
linear order, are not used in

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.990
this kind of straight
linear way.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.490
They are read once they
have folded up into

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.650
three-dimensional structures,
and the folding of proteins

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.860
into these 3D structures is
intrinsic and essential for

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.171
their function.

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:07.421
So protein folding --

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.910
Actually, let me before we do
protein folding, I realize

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.580
I've been remiss in giving
you these slides.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.470
Here is something I drew
for you on amino acid

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.643
polymerization from your
book, and here we are

00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:27.300
where we should be.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:32.320
Protein folding is required
for function.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.580
The linear order of amino acids
in the first peptide

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.170
chain that is synthesized is
called the primary structure.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.380
So primary structure refers
to the linear

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.650
order of amino acids.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.160
And these amino acids, of
course, are held together by

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.690
covalent bonds as in
peptide bonds.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.220
But this primary structure,
while absolutely essential for

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.000
protein function, is not
the functional protein.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.880
It folds up, this primary
structure, this linear chain,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.780
folds up and folds again
and folds again.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.850
The way I think of it is, if you
took a piece of string or

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.580
an old-fashioned telephone cord,
and you folded it up,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:50.110
you start rolling it up into a
roll, it will roll up, and

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.810
it'll fold back on itself, and
fold back on itself, and fold

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.170
back on itself.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.770
And that's kind of the
deal with proteins.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.540
So we have to consider something
called secondary

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:10.750
structure where the linear chain
of amino acids folds

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.310
back on itself.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:23.150
So the linear amino acid
chain folds up, and it

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.060
does so in two ways.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:32.810
It forms something called an
alpha helix or it forms

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.420
something called a beta sheet
or a beta pleated sheet, and

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.480
these are characteristics
folding structure or folding

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.360
patterns that are governed
by hydrogen bonds.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.860
But that secondary structure
of the protein is not the

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.050
functional protein.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.180
Those folded hydrogen-bonded
alpha helices or beta sheets

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:06.910
fold on themselves again to form
the tertiary structure of

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.270
the protein.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:16.900
So this is more folding
of the alpha

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:24.270
helices or the beta sheets.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.060
And this tertiary structure
can involve any number of

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.840
different kinds of bonds.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.800
It can involve covalent bonds
like sulfhydryl disulfide

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.330
bonds, hydrogen bonds,
hydrophobic bonds, and all of

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.960
these things give a tertiary
structure.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.720
All of them use one linear
polypeptide or protein chain.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.610
But then there's a fourth
folding that is required for

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.720
the function of many proteins.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:02.670
This is the quaternary
structure, and this refers to,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:11.504
so again, this is of the primary
and secondary chain.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.270
The quaternary structure is
an association between two

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.020
different proteins in a
non-covalent way, usually.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:46.370
So this is association between
two different protein chains

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.300
and two different protein chains
that are in some kind

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.230
of tertiary structure.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.520
And usually this association
is non-covalent.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:08.450
The way protein structure is
governed and proteins fold is

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.480
mysterious, and very
complicated, and not well

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.600
understood.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.350
And there we go.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.000
Look at this interesting stuff
you can see on my screen.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.140
Here we go.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.370
Here, not from your book because
I think it's better

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.490
from a different book, is a
picture of an alpha helix, a

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:31.330
beta sheet, tertiary structures
of folded

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.290
polypeptide chains.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.650
And here is a quaternary
structure.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.930
And as we'll talk about on
Friday, it's the quaternary

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.890
structures that are these
functional units called

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.370
enzymes, and we'll stop there.
