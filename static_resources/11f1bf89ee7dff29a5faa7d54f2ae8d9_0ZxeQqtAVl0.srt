1
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,150
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about what
was probably the first

2
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,442
energy producing system
that evolved.

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,840
The thought is when the earth
first formed and the first

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,530
primitive organisms, perhaps
resembling a present-day

5
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,550
bacterium in some way came
out, there were a lot of

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,970
organic compounds that had
been aided by lightning

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,410
strikes and cosmic radiations
triggering chemical

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,615
reactions and so on.

9
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:49,980
So there was food around, but
they depleted those resources

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,820
in the same way we're depleting
the petroleum

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,180
resources right now.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,950
If life was going to continue,
somehow a way had to be found

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,790
to make energy.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:09,220
Glycolysis, it looks kind
of complicated.

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,760
It takes a molecule of sugar and
then there are a series of

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,060
10 chemical reactions, each
catalyzed by a separate enzyme

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:42,940
that give two molecules of this,
molecules of pyruvate,

18
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:51,990
plus two ATPs, plus two NADHs.

19
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,320
Which tells you there must
have been some kind of

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,020
oxidation step as part of this
sequence of events, because

21
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,190
electrons got taken off and
got stashed on this NADH.

22
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,250
There are a couple of things
that are important about this.

23
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,340
One is its a pathway.

24
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,600
It evolved probably 3.7 billion
years ago or sometime,

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,980
nobody really knows.

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,990
But a long time ago.

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,000
It's pretty much universal.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,037
Not perfectly so, but it's
in bacteria, it's in

29
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,045
yeast, it's in humans.

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:45,220
And another really important
thing is that it evolved early

31
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,120
in the evolution of earth, so
it evolved when there was no

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,580
oxygen around.

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,440
So it's a way of making
energy from glucose in

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,740
the absence of oxygen.

35
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,280
Which is a really important
thing as you'll

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,920
see as we go along.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,080
You're not going to have to
memorize this pathway.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
We'll give it to you
if you need it.

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,070
But you're going to need to
understand its implications.

40
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,300
And just let me point out
a couple of things.

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,340
You're going to see a sequence
of 10 chemical transformations

42
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,850
that in the end are going to
end up with a couple of

43
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,910
pyruvates being produced.

44
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,220
And I'll try to explain
to you why you

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,010
should care about this.

46
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,940
There's a concept that you're
familiar with, that if you

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,170
want to make something and you
get a little start up company,

48
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,980
what's the very first thing
you have to do?

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,060
You actually have to
make an investment

50
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,030
before you can get going.

51
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,370
And you're out looking for
venture capital things.

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,840
Well one of the odd things about
this, here's probably

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,380
the first sequence of reactions
that arose on earth

54
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,520
within some organism and enabled
that organism to make

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,490
energy out of glucose.

56
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,810
And look, the first thing
that happens.

57
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,270
Trying to make ATP, the very
first thing it does is it

58
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,370
spends an ATP.

59
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,020
And it takes glucose, and it
makes glucose 6-phosphate.

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,420
Go down a couple of steps.

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,769
There's an enzyme that takes
another molecule of ATP.

62
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,110
And now you've got this point.

63
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,130
You're at fructose with
two phosphates on it.

64
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,560
If this was your venture
capital, we'd say, guys, how

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
about some product?

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,760
Stop spending, stop
spending money.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,520
But at this point then, this
is a 6-carbon sugar.

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,970
And it gets split into two
3-carbon compounds that are

69
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,720
going back and forth.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,550
Oh I can see it.

71
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,800
It's over there, OK.

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,740
In equilibrium over here.

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,650
And this particular 3-carbon
compound then

74
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,820
goes on to be oxidized.

75
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,030
You get the production
of NADH.

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,570
And at that point, this molecule
has a lot of energy

77
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,430
stored in it, and in the next
transformation this cell is

78
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,960
able to make two ATPs.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,820
And it gets back the
initial investment.

80
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,320
It goes all the way through
the rest of the pathway.

81
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,650
And the very last step, you
get two more ATPs back.

82
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,000
There's your net yield.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,610
So what you get out of this
are 4ATP+2NADH, and your

84
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,380
investment was two ATPs.

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,720
So your net 2ATP+NADH.

86
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,640
Why is this cell going and
doing these initial

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,240
investments?

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Well if we look at the changes
in free energy associated with

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,110
what's going on, there's glucose
up in the upper left

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,710
starting up there, and there's
pyruvate down there.

91
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,010
So you're going energetically
downhill in the end.

92
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,350
So this is a sequence of events
that, in principle, you

93
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,660
should be able to get some
energy out of it.

94
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,570
But for reasons that may seem
obscure to you at this point,

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,040
before it gets to the point of
making energy, it undergoes a

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,590
set of transformations that's
pushing the reaction.

97
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,870
It requires the reactants to go
energetically uphill, i.e.

98
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,590
in an unfavorable direction.

99
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,960
So what the cell does is, by
coupling ATP hydrolysis to

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,220
this step, it makes
that reaction go.

101
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,780
Here's another unfavorable one
that makes that one go by

102
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,360
coupling ATP hydrolysis to it.

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,590
This is an uphill reaction,
but look over here.

104
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,710
This is an immensely favorable
reaction that goes essentially

105
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,150
to completion.

106
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,570
It goes all the way.

107
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,480
So that means this product is
just being continually taken

108
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,780
out of the system, so the
equilibrium is basically being

109
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,520
pulled over the edge by the
removal of that product.

110
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,270
This is where the oxidation
takes place.

111
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,580
You get the NADH made
right there.

112
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,770
And it's finally down here
where you've got to lose.

113
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,080
This transformation gives you
two ATPs and later there's

114
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,930
another one.

115
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,690
Let me just give you
a sense of why you

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,540
get ATP at that step.

117
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:36,460
The compound that you have
at that point is 1, 3

118
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,710
diphosphoglycerate.

119
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,710
Or sometimes this is
called bis, is also

120
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,930
used to describe this.

121
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,750
But what is this compound?

122
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,770
It's a 3-carbon compound.

123
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,020
So glycerate is basically an
oxidized version of glycerol

124
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,080
that has been oxidized up
to a carboxyl acid.

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,230
So this is a mixed anhydride
between carboxyl acid and a

126
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,400
phosphate ion.

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,210
So that's a very reactive
and unstable compound.

128
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,980
And the other thing that the
cell has succeeded in doing by

129
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,669
all of these transformations
is it's got these two

130
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,760
phosphates with all their
negative charges in.

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,010
So this is a compound that would
very much like to move

132
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,230
to a lower energy.

133
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,000
So you can get rid of this
phosphate and move to an

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,320
energy level, use that
energy to make ATP.

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
And there's a similar kind of
logic that explains why you

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,510
get energy out of the final
step when you look at it.

137
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,760
So there's several points, I
guess, to make out of this.

138
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,330
One is its pathway.

139
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,380
None of these reactions make
any particular sense by

140
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,990
themselves.

141
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,120
You could have a cell that knew
how to do one of them and

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,170
it would gain nothing.

143
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,040
Unless you wanted to use the
product to make something.

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,720
This thing only makes sense,
these reactions only make

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,810
sense in the context of
this 10 step pathway.

146
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,200
And each step in that pathway
we were looking at is

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
catalyzed by a different
enzyme.

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
So for an organism to pull this
off, the first one that

149
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,670
did it had to collect in one
cell all 10 of those enzymes.

150
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,870
And probably there is the reason
that this is such a

151
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,720
complicated system.

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,040
If you were sitting as a
designer you might be able to

153
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,080
come up now with a more
efficient way to get ATP out.

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,880
But what happened evolutionarily
was some bug

155
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,910
somewhere got all of these
things together, and now

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,210
suddenly it could make energy.

157
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,360
So it had a huge advantage
over everybody else.

158
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,110
And once it took over, that
system took over, then it

159
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,820
became universal.

160
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,440
Whether it was the best that
ever could be designed, it

161
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,100
doesn't matter, because it
had an evolutionary edge.

162
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,700
And that's so, to some extent,
we're looking at a living

163
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,120
fossil, biochemical.

164
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,750
But it's in bacteria, it's in
yeast, and it's going on

165
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,320
inside of our body.

166
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,790
Another principle that I think
you can see here, which I've

167
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,260
been trying to say, is in this
case, the energy consuming

168
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,030
reactions are driven by
coupling them to the

169
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,400
hydrolysis of ATP.

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,740
The cell spends a bit of its
energy money to get these

171
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,440
intermediates, knowing
that it's invest--

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,160
well not knowing, but at least
conceptually anyway, knowing

173
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,650
that it's going to get
its investment back.

174
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,400
And then the reactions that
release energy are used to

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,770
drive the synthesis of ATP.

176
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,830
And you'll begin to see, we're
going to just talk about some

177
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,090
other aspects of this
in just a minute.

178
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,850
So, what do you think?

179
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,850
You're the first bug and you've
got this and nobody

180
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,420
else can do it, so you can
start charging away.

181
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,360
What do we need to do?

182
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
We just let this thing
cycle away?

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,780
The stuff that I had up there,
is it going to work?

184
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,460
There's a problem.

185
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,820
Anybody see what
the problem is?

186
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,320
We're making two molecules of
ATP and two molecules of NADH.

187
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:00,240
Talk to the person beside you.

188
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,394
Figure out why something
else has to happen.

189
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,876
Go ahead.

190
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,358
See if you've got any ideas.

191
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,290
We're going to keep doing
this, over and

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,070
over and over again.

193
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

194
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,516
Where's the first ATP?

195
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:38,040
Where's the first ATP?

196
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,990
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
imagine for the--

197
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,880
I don't think this process could
have invented ATP, it

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,540
had to have been around,
because many of the

199
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,010
enzymes used it.

200
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,940
What else is being used
in this thing though?

201
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,553
Did I hear NAD?

202
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,610
To make this thing work, I have
to keep taking NADs out

203
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,400
of my pocket and putting it in
the reaction, or it isn't

204
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,040
going to go anywhere.

205
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,870
So this isn't such a great
invention at the moment.

206
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:21,460
We have to do something to get
the NADH back to NAD+ so we

207
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,300
can do another molecule
of glucose.

208
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,835
You guys see?

209
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:26,660
Do you see this?

210
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,520
This is really, really an
important consideration.

211
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,160
So in order for cells to make
energy using glycolysis in the

212
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,150
absence of oxygen, which is when
it evolved, they have to

213
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,700
do something with that NADH or
it's only going to use up the

214
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,060
few molecules of NAD+ in the
cell, and then it stops.

215
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,570
And so there are two ways
that nature's figured.

216
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,820
Major ways nature had figured
out how to do that.

217
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,200
So here's a molecule
of pyruvate.

218
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,980
I got an extra.

219
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,300
Something was nagging at me
when I did this here.

220
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,380
Sorry about that.

221
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,570
It's always hard to see things
when you're up at the board.

222
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,900
OK.

223
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,710
Molecule of pyruvate.

224
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,270
There's a couple of solutions
that have been arrived at.

225
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:36,580
One is to take NADH,
2NADH, this is 2H+.

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:47,620
Convert, make these back into
2NAD+, and to take those

227
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:55,320
electrons and put them on the
pyruvate to give this

228
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,340
molecule, which is
lactic acid.

229
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,650
So by parking the electrons
there, the cell is able to

230
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,570
recycle the NADH.

231
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,490
And lactic acid, we've
run into that.

232
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,250
That's why I showed you this
picture of yogurt.

233
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,530
The lactobacilli that make
yogurt take the sugars that

234
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,760
are present in milk and make
them into lactic acid.

235
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,850
And what's interesting in
their case is they, even

236
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,350
though there's oxygen around,
they don't do respiration,

237
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,100
which you'll see you can
get more energy.

238
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,500
They want it to get very acidic
because that prevents

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,120
their competitors
from growing.

240
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,570
And that's why you can leave
yogurt sitting out on the

241
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,900
tabletop and it'll be OK
for quite a while.

242
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,660
Whereas if you left some milk
or something it'll go bad

243
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,910
almost right away.

244
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,650
Here's another example of
when we run into it.

245
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,400
When we do hard aerobic
exercise, when you're running

246
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,720
or skating really hard, things
you see in the Olympics all

247
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,125
the time, you deplete the oxygen
supply in your blood

248
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,580
when you do hard anaerobic
exercise.

249
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,770
And so the cells have the same
problem of regenerating NADH.

250
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,910
The way they solve it is they
make the lactic acid.

251
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,570
And that contributes to the sore
muscles you feel after

252
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,830
you've done hard anaerobic
training.

253
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:29,990
The other way of handling this
is to take the 2NADH plus two

254
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:39,460
hydrogen ions to make it
into acetaldehyde, two

255
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,710
acetaldehydes.

256
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,834
Plus two CO2s.

257
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,466
Oops, excuse me.

258
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,430
Let's do this first.

259
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,960
And then take the 2NADH
plus the 2H+.

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,740
Convert this to 2NAD+, and what
we get out of this are

261
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:11,470
two molecules of ethanol plus
two molecules of CO2.

262
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,510
Again, a process that's very
similar to you, familiar to

263
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,369
you, when I was showing
you yeast growing.

264
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,790
What yeast is doing is it's
carrying out glycolysis and

265
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,869
then it's taking those extra
electrons, putting them on the

266
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,755
pyruvate and making ethanol
and carbon dioxide.

267
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,520
I think there's a fermentation
with what we call a

268
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,750
fermentation with yeast.

269
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,700
I think in that case they're
making bourbon whiskey.

270
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,130
Wine making, beer making,
it's all the same thing.

271
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,980
You have yeast, you're
converting the sugars first to

272
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,150
pyruvate, and then making
ethanol and carboxylic acid.

273
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,880
So anyway.

274
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
There's no energy gain out
of this, but these

275
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
are important processes.

276
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,570
They're called fermentation.

277
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,590
And they can happen when there's
no oxygen around.

278
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:24,950
If you recall, there's a version
of photosynthesis,

279
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,660
what I called the second release
of photosynthesis that

280
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,280
began to evolve oxygen
as a waste product.

281
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,250
And then over the next ensuing
millennia, the levels of

282
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,920
oxygen slowly, slowly began
to rise on earth.

283
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,170
And as oxygen levels got to
higher levels, and recall the

284
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,990
Cambrian period, which
is down on the fourth

285
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,210
blackboard down there.

286
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,890
We were only still even there
half a billion years ago.

287
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,840
We were only about 5% the
present oxygen levels.

288
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,690
But as oxygen levels arose, new
metabolic opportunities

289
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,485
became available.

290
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:07,290
And in particular, cells were
able to get at that energy

291
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,160
which is stored in NADH.

292
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,890
In the absence of oxygen,
NADH is just a nuisance.

293
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,390
You've got to get rid of it.

294
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,010
But as you'll see in a minute,
you can do something

295
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,230
interesting if you have
oxygen around.

296
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,860
So just to look at this from a
broad perspective, if we have

297
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,260
glucose and we have all these
little steps going along to

298
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:35,490
give the two pyruvate, if
there's, in the absence of

299
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:50,380
oxygen, they get 2 lactate or
we can get 2 ethanol, 2CO2.

300
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,690
And in both cases, 2ATP.

301
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,010
2ATP.

302
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,710
These processes happening in the
absence of oxygen to get

303
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,010
rid of the, or at least not
requiring oxygen in any case

304
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,600
called fermentations.

305
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,490
However, when oxygen is
available, it became possible

306
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,630
to evolve a new system for
handling these pyruvates.

307
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,650
We go into a biochemical
cycle known as

308
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,305
the citric acid cycle.

309
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,920
And I'll say a word about
this in a minute.

310
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:44,250
Plus something else that's
known as oxidative

311
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,500
phosphorylation.

312
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,100
This is also referred to as
the respiratory chain.

313
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,710
And what these two sets of
processes together, enable the

314
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,960
cell to take these two 3-carbon
compounds and take

315
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,120
them all the way down to six
molecules of carbon dioxide,

316
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,920
six molecules of water.

317
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:29,010
And to make a net yield of
36 molecules of ATP.

318
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,710
So if you go by fermentation
a molecule of sugar

319
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,650
gives you two ATPs.

320
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,300
If you go by glycolysis and then
follow it by respiration,

321
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,130
you get 36.

322
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:48,350
So respiration using oxygen, 18
times more efficient than

323
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,160
by glycolysis.

324
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,330
So in order to understand how
this works though, we have to

325
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,240
talk more about how you
change from one form

326
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,930
of energy to another.

327
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,275
And it's interesting, although
this process had to have

328
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:10,310
evolved billions of years ago,
it was only relatively

329
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,790
recently that we understood
the principal that was

330
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,460
necessary for this kind
of thing to happen.

331
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:29,460
It's known as the Chemiosmotic
Hypothesis.

332
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:40,740
It was proposed by Peter
Mitchell in 1961.

333
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,550
He eventually got a Nobel
Prize for it.

334
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:49,780
It took quite a long time, it
took more than 10 years for it

335
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,630
to be accepted.

336
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,310
In fact when I was in grad
school in the mid '70s, people

337
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,680
were still arguing whether
this made sense or not.

338
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,340
So here's the way it works.

339
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,390
And we have to consider first
three different forms of

340
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,070
chemical energy that can
be all interconverted.

341
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,110
One of them is familiar to you,
we've been talking about

342
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,270
it all along.

343
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,990
It's a chemical bond.

344
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,745
Energy can be stored in
a high energy bond.

345
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:22,480
And if we break it to get ADP,
an inorganic phosphate, we can

346
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,135
release energy.

347
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:26,600
However there's another way
of storing energy as a

348
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,850
concentration gradient.

349
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,160
The principal here would be to
have a barrier, which in this

350
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,240
case is the cell membrane, and
to have a high concentration

351
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,460
of whatever it is on one side,
and a low concentration on the

352
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,710
other side.

353
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,840
And there's energy
stored in that.

354
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
If you give it a chance it'll
get to be the same

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
concentration on both sides.

356
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,950
And the trick is to have
whatever the substance is, is

357
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,920
to have a protein in the
membrane that can permit this

358
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,510
thing to go across in a
controlled fashion.

359
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,960
The third form is electrical
potential.

360
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:36,340
Again, the membrane actually
acts as an insulator, and all

361
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:52,540
cells, if this is the inside,
and this is the outside,

362
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:59,310
there's a gradient of hydrogen
ions, so there are more

363
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,810
hydrogen ions outside the cell
than there are inside.

364
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:09,450
So it creates an electrical
potential.

365
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,740
And these can't cross the
membrane unless, guess what?

366
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,560
There's a protein in the
membrane that's able to permit

367
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,190
their passage under controlled
circumstances.

368
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,760
So there's basically three
different forms of energy that

369
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,750
can be interconverted.

370
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,660
And Peter Mitchell's great
insight, which I will say was

371
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,730
not intuitive for many people,
was the combination, so the

372
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:53,530
combo of this proton
concentration gradient plus

373
00:25:53,530 --> 00:26:07,580
the electrical potential, could
be used to drive the

374
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,920
synthesis of ATP.

375
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,190
And let me just say
a couple of words.

376
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,805
Because this may feel,
how could this be?

377
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:24,500
Could you really have energy?

378
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:33,242
Well the potential across a cell
is about 70 millivolts.

379
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,690
May not seem all that much.

380
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,720
But remember the membrane is
about three nanometers thick.

381
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,340
So that's about 200,000
volts per centimeter.

382
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,620
High tension wires are 200,000
volts per mile or something.

383
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,880
There's a lot of
power in there.

384
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,500
And furthermore, let's see
if I can bring this up.

385
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,060
I've been showing
you this little

386
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,380
movie a couple of times.

387
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,040
The bacteria with these little
nanomotors are spinning those

388
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,900
flagella, and we saw how there's
this machinery that's

389
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,840
a little nanomotor.

390
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,150
You know how it's powered?

391
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,850
It's powered by the
proton gradient.

392
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,880
A proton trickles its way
through this apparatus from

393
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,460
the outside to the inside.

394
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,010
It's coming down the gradient.

395
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,600
That's the source
of the power.

396
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,310
And as I showed you, it's
a pretty powerful motor.

397
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,990
You can basically glue the
propeller to a slide and it

398
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,010
can twirl the bacteria
all around.

399
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:44,040
In fact, one of my favorite
demos is, years ago people

400
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
took a bacterium, and they
managed to pop it open.

401
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,280
So all the cytoplasm, all of the
stuff on the inside came

402
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,130
out of the cell, and you just
got buffer on the inside.

403
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,530
But it had these flagella.

404
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:06,950
So you had just shells of
bacteria with nothing really

405
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,990
inside them.

406
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,850
But, if you add a drop of acid
to this media, now you've

407
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,500
created a proton gradient with
more protons on the outside

408
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,970
than are on the inside, and
guess what happens?

409
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,540
The flagella motor starts
working, and the bacteria

410
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,710
start swimming, even though all
the air, talk about dead

411
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,640
man walking or something
like that.

412
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,080
It gives you an idea of the
power that's in this

413
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,720
combination of the proton
gradient and

414
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,210
the electric potential.

415
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:49,970
The combination of this is
often referred to as the

416
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,230
proton motive force.

417
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,450
So here's the principle
of how the cell is

418
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,220
able to exploit that.

419
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,800
And this is what underlies
respiration.

420
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,050
There are two stages.

421
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:19,810
Stage one, there's a membrane
with some kind of membrane

422
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:27,510
protein in it, which is actually
a protein, functions

423
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,300
as a proton pump.

424
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,310
So it's a protein that's
designed to be embedded into a

425
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,640
membrane and to work there.

426
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,550
This part here is the
membrane itself.

427
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:52,340
The proton gets transported from
the inside to the outside

428
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,350
when energy is put into
this proton pump.

429
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:03,160
So in response to some energy
producing event, the cell

430
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,790
pumps protons from its inside to
its outside, and this then

431
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,415
establishes the proton
gradient.

432
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:31,590
The second phase, then, is to
take advantage of that proton

433
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,160
gradient, and there's a
different protein embedded in

434
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,676
the membrane.

435
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:43,890
It's known as an ATP synthase.

436
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:51,550
And it permits a proton to come
down the gradient, which

437
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,880
you would want to do.

438
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,830
But if that's all that happened,
all you'd do is

439
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,960
you'd just dissipate
your gradient.

440
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,580
So the key here is that this
proton is only allowed to come

441
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,530
down the gradient to the
energetically more favorable

442
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:12,750
side if ADP and inorganic
phosphate are bound to this

443
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,380
ATP synthase.

444
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,340
And the dropping of the proton
down the gradient's passage

445
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,900
through this ATP synthase, which
is an energy favorable

446
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,400
reaction, drives the
synthesis of ATP.

447
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,850
So much energy is basically
given off with this, you can

448
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,970
make an ATP and the thing
will still go.

449
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:41,910
Now interestingly, this ATP
synthase, which really lies at

450
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,930
the heart of our energetics for
how we function as human

451
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:57,990
beings, is derived from it's
crystal structure.

452
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,600
But in fact, evolutionarily,
it's related to

453
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,360
that flagella motor.

454
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,670
And as that proton comes down
the gradient, or actually this

455
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,470
is presented upside down, so
there's the outside as it goes

456
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,070
through in this direction, the
ATP synthase, which is known

457
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:29,990
as the F1F0 ATP synthase
rotates.

458
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,590
And probably this came first.

459
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,390
It's a little hard in this one
because you don't have the

460
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,690
flagella, so what scientists
have done is they've been able

461
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,120
to attach something like an
actin filament onto this F1

462
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,130
ATP synthase, and show
that as a proton

463
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,650
passages the thing rotates.

464
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,710
So in all likelihood what
happened in evolution was this

465
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:59,690
came first, and then later the
machinery got duplicated and

466
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,120
evolved to become a nanomotor.

467
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,610
And as I told you the other day,
that apparatus for the

468
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,920
flagella motor got evolved again
into becoming a little

469
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:17,050
syringe that bacteria like
ursinia are able to use to

470
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,240
pump or to squeeze proteins or
squirt proteins from inside

471
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,780
them into inside of
a mammalian cell.

472
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,080
OK, well.

473
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,460
Thanks to this work by Peter
Mitchell then, we can now

474
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,840
understand how cells were able
to take advantage of that

475
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,805
energy that was in the NADH.

476
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,230
So this process is known
as respiration.

477
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:58,680
And basically it's
taking the 2NADH.

478
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm supposed to see the physical
therapist today, so I

479
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,110
hope we're going to begin to
make progress to lecturing on

480
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,460
two feet sooner or later.

481
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:19,570
Plus 2NAD+ plus two water.

482
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:25,389
So as I said earlier,
NADH and protons,

483
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,909
it's basically hydrogen.

484
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,090
It's the equivalent of having
hydrogen gas and adding

485
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,830
oxygen, and we're burning the
hydrogen gas down to water.

486
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,429
So there's a lot
to yield water.

487
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,560
So there's a lot of energy
potentially can be given off.

488
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,630
That's the 50 kcals per mole.

489
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,730
Now if you recall when we talked
about thermodynamics,

490
00:34:51,730 --> 00:35:08,660
so the NADH is up here, by the
time we get down to the 2NAD+

491
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,830
plus the water, the two waters,

492
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,960
energetically we're down here.

493
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,930
And this is about a free energy
changed of about 50

494
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,990
kcals per mole.

495
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,610
In physiological terms, that's
a huge amount of energy.

496
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,250
And I think some of the
textbooks compare it to

497
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,910
letting a stick of dynamite
off inside of a cell.

498
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,650
So it's really more than biology
figured out how to

499
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,780
handle this in a single step.

500
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,800
But do you remember that
important principle about a

501
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,450
thermodynamic property,
when I had the little

502
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,410
picture of the skier?

503
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,730
It doesn't matter which
pathway you take.

504
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,520
You get the same amount of
energy released whether you go

505
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,790
down the black diamond
slope or you go

506
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,420
down the bunny slope.

507
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:01,750
So in fact, the way biology has
learned, life has learned

508
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,960
to control this amount of energy
is basically taking the

509
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,290
bunny slope.

510
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:14,350
And so the energy drop occurs
in a series of stages, where

511
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,720
you have the transfer of two
electrons to a lower state

512
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,760
intermediate, transfer of two
electrons to another one,

513
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,400
transfer of two electrons
to another one.

514
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,560
And where this connects with
the stuff that I just told

515
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,800
you, is as these two electrons
are coming down, what's

516
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,740
happening is a proton is
being pumped from the

517
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,250
inside to the outside.

518
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:47,750
As it moves to the next lower
energy state, another proton

519
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,860
gets pumped from the inside,
the outside.

520
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,590
And the same thing
happens here.

521
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:08,790
So at the end, you get the two
hydrogens plus the half of an

522
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,680
oxygen and we get
a water molecule

523
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,010
from these two electrons.

524
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,890
But what's happened is these
three protons have changed

525
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,820
from inside to outside.

526
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,500
That enables the cell
to make three ATPs.

527
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,740
So now instead of throwing away
all that energy, losing

528
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,560
the NADH as in the
fermentations, the cell is

529
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,940
extracting energy out of it by
taking advantage of this

530
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,440
principle of the proton
gradient.

531
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,720
So the game changes
if you're this

532
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,530
evolutionary designer or something.

533
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,390
If you were trying to design
life from first principles

534
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,950
now, you could take
advantage of this.

535
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,350
Well of course it doesn't
happen that way.

536
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,620
Experiments happen all the time
in nature and something

537
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,940
happens and sometimes
it's very efficient,

538
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,860
sometimes it isn't.

539
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,160
But if it's there first
it gets going.

540
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,440
In this case, the need now, or
the opportunity was that if an

541
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:20,505
organism could get more NADH out
of that original molecule

542
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:24,400
of glucose, it could make more
energy than somebody else.

543
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,950
And so the ultimate way to take
a molecule of glucose is

544
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,560
if you burn it with, oxygen
you end up with six carbon

545
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,990
dioxides and water.

546
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,410
You burn it all away.

547
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,590
So there's a system that,
in essence, does that.

548
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,130
It's known as the citric
acid cycle.

549
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:55,080
So you have the pyruvate that
comes from glycolysis.

550
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,680
And the way it's processed is
first, one of the carboxyl

551
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,620
group on the pyruvate
is released, and

552
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,480
this produces acetyl.

553
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,610
You can look to see
what CoA is.

554
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,900
At the moment, it
doesn't matter.

555
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,830
What does matter is this
is a 3-carbon compound.

556
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,700
Acetyl, as you probably know,
is a two-carbon compound.

557
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,790
And when you look in your
textbooks at the citric acid

558
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:33,990
cycle, you'll see this very
confusing circle with lots of

559
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,360
compounds and enzymes
and stuff.

560
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,850
But I want you just keep your
eye on the ball here.

561
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,750
If you'll notice, the compound
over here is in the cycle, is

562
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,390
four carbons.

563
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,480
And what happens is this
2-carbon compound that was

564
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,170
derived from pyruvate gets
added to this to give a

565
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,080
6-carbon compound.

566
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,690
And then that gets converted to
a 5-carbon compound with a

567
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,980
molecule of CO2 being
given off.

568
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,120
That in turn gets converted to
a 4-carbon compound with

569
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,480
another molecule of
CO2 given off.

570
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,400
And then there's some molecular
gymnastics here that

571
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,620
change the nature of the four
carbon compound a bit so you

572
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,940
can get back into the cycle.

573
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,970
But look what's happened to
those three carbons that were

574
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,280
in the pyruvate.

575
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,850
There's one of them, there's
the other one,

576
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,490
there's the other one.

577
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,250
So this citric acid cycle
produces, it actually makes

578
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,840
some ATP, but it makes
quite a bit of NADH.

579
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:58,000
And it also makes another, one
more reduced electron carrier.

580
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,920
It's not NADH, it's another one
that's used in the cell.

581
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,160
But anyway, the cell is then
able to take all of this NADH

582
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,250
and this electron carrier plus
these to give you, what I'd

583
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,430
said, the net yield you
get from respiration.

584
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:25,330
36 ATPs from a single
molecule of glucose.

585
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,205
So sort of quite remarkable
to some extent.

586
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:32,960
We're looking at evolution,
through, if you will, almost

587
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,770
like looking at biochemical
fossils and then when

588
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,060
something works, it's a living
fossil, we still

589
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,550
find it in our cells.
