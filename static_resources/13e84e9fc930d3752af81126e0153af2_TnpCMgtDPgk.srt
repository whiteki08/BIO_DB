1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,540
ERIC LANDER: So, now what I'd
like to do is turn to

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,310
variations on the theme.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,770
One of the best ways to
understand what's going on

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,040
with DNA goes to RNA goes to
protein is to consider how it

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,500
works in different organisms.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,580
And the organisms we'll consider
are eukaryotes, like

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:50,000
you; prokaryotes, like a
bacterium; and viruses.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,990
And each does the same basic
copying of nucleic acid to

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,630
nucleic acid, transcription,
and translation.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,280
But there are some pretty
fascinating

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,080
variations on the theme.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,860
So let's turn to those
variations.

13
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,183
Let's start with DNA
replication.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:29,530
For eukaryotes, your genome are
long, double-stranded DNA

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,450
molecules, and they're linear.

16
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,310
Long, linear, double
stranded--

17
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,880
ds for double.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,476
I'll write it out-- double
stranded DNA.

19
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:45,850
You know this.

20
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,320
And you've got a lot of it.

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:02:02,190
The human, you actually have
23 pairs of chromosomes.

22
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,190
And the total length of your DNA
is about 3 times 10 to the

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,700
ninth base pairs.

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,890
So about 3 billion bases or so,
typical chromosome on the

25
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,330
order of about 150 million
bases or so.

26
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,100
The mouse, pretty similar.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,060
Mouse, 20 pairs of
chromosomes.

28
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,810
And it's something like 2.7
times 10 to the ninth bases.

29
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,030
The dog's about 2.5, the
elephant's about 3.3,

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,600
essentially all mammals are
about 3 times 10 to the ninth.

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,790
Tomatoes, 12 chromosomes.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,370
They're also in the
neighborhood of 3

33
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,630
times 10 to the ninth.

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,400
You don't have more DNA than
a tomato, for example.

35
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,830
Yeast, much smaller genome.

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,080
Yeast is like--

37
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,810
it's got 16 chromosomes.

38
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,720
Yeast is in the neighborhood
of about 13 million bases

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,370
instead of billions of bases.

40
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,910
Fruit flies, four chromosomes,
including a pretty measly one.

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,870
And it's in the order of 200
million bases, et cetera.

42
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,770
Many different sizes
for eukaryotes.

43
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,810
But there's one significant
issue that all eukaryotes

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,800
have, which is this chromosome
here, this linear chromosome,

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,770
how do we replicate it?

46
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,470
Well, we told you.

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,970
We open up a bubble.

48
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,600
We start making little
primers.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,640
Primase makes primers, you
extend it, it's all just fine.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,175
Except in one place, the end.

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,650
Primase makes a primer,
continues

52
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,515
to the end, no problem.

53
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,640
What happens out there
at the end?

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,370
Suppose primase sits
down here.

55
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,504
What happens at the very
end of the chromosome?

56
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,980
If my primer wasn't exactly at
the end of the chromosome,

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,990
what happens?

58
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,430
STUDENT: A little bit of it
doesn't get replicated.

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,566
ERIC LANDER: A little bit
doesn't get replicated.

60
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,550
Does that matter?

61
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,244
Just a little bit--

62
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:41,030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

63
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,470
ERIC LANDER: --per
cell division.

64
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,990
Every cell division, you lose
a little bit of information

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,240
off the end of your
chromosome.

66
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,400
That's not so good .

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,820
The word for end is tel.

68
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,510
And so the ends of chromosomes
are called telomeres.

69
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,930
And if you have a linear
chromosome, you have a problem

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,540
with replicating your telomeres
because it's going

71
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,375
to get a little short
each cell division.

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,360
So what do you think
the cell does?

73
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,010
Special mechanism, special
enzyme that

74
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,910
comes along and adds--

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,330
there's a repeat sequence
that occurs.

76
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,650
There's a repetitive sequence
that occurs out here.

77
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,350
T2AGGG in humans, different
things in other organisms.

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,750
And there's a specific enzyme
that comes along and adds back

79
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,570
telomeres so you don't get in
trouble failing to replicate

80
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,710
enough stuff at the end.

81
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,880
By chance, the enzyme happens
to be called--?

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,740
STUDENT: Telomerase.

83
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,370
ERIC LANDER: Telomerase.

84
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,710
And some folks got a Nobel Prize
for this last year, for

85
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,805
understanding how telomerase
works.

86
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,540
What cells in your body are
in need of replicating and

87
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,380
replicating and replicating?

88
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,410
Well, not necessarily
in your body.

89
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,085
What cells in some people are
replicating and replicating

90
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:18,950
and replicating and
replicating?

91
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,500
Cancer cells.

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,900
Cancer cells probably need
their telomerase, right?

93
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,980
So one way to possibly treat
cancer might be to inhibit

94
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,476
telomerase.

95
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,880
So you see, all the things I'm
telling you about, these are

96
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,890
useful fun facts to know and
tell about how the cell works.

97
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,580
They're also the heart of a lot
of approaches in medicine.

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,440
Because if you could
specifically inhibit

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,350
telomerase, you might
specifically create a

100
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,960
liability for rapidly
dividing cells.

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
And so telomerase,
very interesting.

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,150
Anyway, so a linear chromosome
has that problem.

103
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,980
And if you understood our
mechanisms for replication,

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,680
you'll understand there why the
linear chromosome needs

105
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,860
some special mechanism.

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,660
Now, here, prokaryotes
are much easier.

107
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:09,450
Because most prokaryotes have
circular chromosomes,

108
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,730
double-stranded circular--

109
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,990
ds circular--

110
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,240
DNA.

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,870
This is much easier because
there are no ends.

112
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,720
They don't have to worry about
the telomerase problem.

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,890
They start somewhere, they start
replicating around, it

114
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,490
all works fine.

115
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:33,250
E. coli, for example, 4
million bases of DNA.

116
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,895
The smallest are
microbacteria.

117
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,090
They're on the order of about
a million bases of DNA.

118
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,400
And they work just like
we talked about.

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:54,580
But now, viruses,
they are weird.

120
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,302
Viruses --

121
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:12,840
Turns out some viruses have some
double-stranded linear

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,120
DNA, and some with multiple
chromosomes, even.

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:26,110
Some viruses, though, have
double-stranded circular DNA.

124
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,800
So it turns out viruses can
do either of those.

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,070
It turns out they can
do more than that.

126
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:48,390
Some viruses have
single-stranded circular DNA.

127
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,130
That is to say, when they're
traveling around in their

128
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,590
capsid, in the protein coat,
what's in the protein coat

129
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,590
that you get infected with is
a single-strand of DNA.

130
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,840
Well, how does it replicate?

131
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,975
When it gets in, it becomes
double stranded.

132
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:21,380
The first thing it has to do is
polymerases end up making

133
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,640
this guy double stranded.

134
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,820
But it travels around in its
single-stranded form.

135
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,320
Why?

136
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,860
Because it decided to.

137
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,210
The great thing about viruses
is they are small.

138
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,280
They've had a chance to
experiment with a zillion

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
different things.

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,430
But some viruses don't have
any DNA at all when they

141
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,640
travel around.

142
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,320
Instead of having DNA, they
alternatively could have RNA.

143
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,240
Remember I said Crick already
figured out DNA and RNA are

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,670
essentially equivalent.

145
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,030
They're both nucleic acid.

146
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,830
You can go from one
to the other.

147
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:05,310
Some viruses decided to bring
along single-stranded RNA.

148
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,460
So when the virus attaches to
the cell, it injects an RNA.

149
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,710
The RNA is in the cell.

150
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,245
But how is the virus going
to do anything?

151
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,490
How's it going to replicate
itself?

152
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,940
How do you replicate RNA?

153
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,450
Well, the same stuff I told you
about replicating DNA--

154
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,460
namely, for replicating DNA
you use a DNA polymerase.

155
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,885
It's a DNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

156
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,670
It uses DNA as a template.

157
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,410
Any reason not to have an
RNA-directed RNA polymerase?

158
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,840
No.

159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
You can have one of those.

160
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,400
So the way this works is
this gets replicated

161
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,630
into a strand of RNA.

162
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,590
It makes double-stranded RNA
by an RNA-directed RNA

163
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,840
polymerase.

164
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,090
That's a kind of weird enzyme.

165
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,280
It takes RNA as its template.

166
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
And it uses RNA as its
template, and it

167
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,420
makes another copy.

168
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,160
It makes a strand of RNA to
make it double stranded.

169
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,830
And then it goes back and makes
another strand of RNA.

170
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,070
But you don't have
that enzyme.

171
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,264
Where does that enzyme
come from?

172
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,470
STUDENT: The virus.

173
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,845
ERIC LANDER: The virus?

174
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,255
Did it bring it with it?

175
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,200
STUDENT: Another cell
that it infects?

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,020
ERIC LANDER: Another
cell that infects?

177
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,790
STUDENT: The RNA encodes--

178
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,480
STUDENT: The RNA does--

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,100
ERIC LANDER: Whoa!

180
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,660
Wouldn't it be cool if the RNA
was a messenger RNA and it

181
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,700
encoded a protein, and the
protein it encoded was the

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,060
RNA-directed RNA polymerase?

183
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,040
Bingo.

184
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,280
That is, in fact, what happens
with a certain class of what

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,600
are called plus-strand
viruses.

186
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,980
This is a messenger.

187
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,870
It's a messenger RNA.

188
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,370
And it's actually encodes the
instructions to the cell,

189
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,340
please make me an RNA-directed
RNA polymerase.

190
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,590
That's way cool.

191
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,310
It also turns out that some
viruses are what are called

192
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,870
minus-strand viruses.

193
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,390
They don't bring a
messenger RNA.

194
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,340
But instead, like you said,
they bring their own

195
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,240
polymerase with them.

196
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,620
The polymerase comes--

197
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,405
So here, these bring the
instructions for a polymerase.

198
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,550
These actually bring the
polymerase itself.

199
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,010
The polymerase then copies
this strand, which is the

200
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,790
messenger RNA.

201
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,490
And it makes more RNA-directed
RNA polymerases.

202
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,510
So both of your two
solutions--

203
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,400
the virus brings a polymerase
with itself, or the virus

204
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
brings the instructions
for the polymerase.

205
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,280
Both of those actually happen.

206
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,720
Pretty much a good rule with
viruses is anything that can

207
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,900
happen does happen.

208
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,400
This is pretty much Murphy's
rule for viruses there.

209
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,620
Turns out viruses can
do one other thing.

210
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:53,060
It turns out that viruses can
take that RNA strand--

211
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,400
RNA--

212
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,620
and, although I won't go into
all the details, copy that RNA

213
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:14,340
strand into a DNA strand and
then copy that DNA strand to a

214
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,010
second DNA strand, to make
double-stranded DNA.

215
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,800
So some viruses that bring RNA
with them copy themselves not

216
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,080
into more RNA, but
back into DNA.

217
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,270
So instead of an RNA-directed
RNA polymerase or a

218
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,040
DNA-directed DNA polymerase,
what is this?

219
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,216
It's an RNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

220
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,410
So this is an RNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

221
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,280
In effect, what is
this thing doing?

222
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,960
It's doing the exact opposite
of transcription.

223
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,470
What's transcription?

224
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,010
Reading DNA into RNA.

225
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,300
What's this guy doing?

226
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,880
Reading RNA into DNA.

227
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,770
It's the reverse of
transcription.

228
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,130
What is the enzyme called?

229
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,380
Reverse transcriptase.

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,010
It's called reverse
transcriptase.

231
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,070
And then what happens is quite
insidious, is that if this is

232
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:48,560
your own chromosomal DNA, that
piece of double-stranded DNA

233
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,000
from the virus can be inserted
into your own human

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,250
chromosome.

235
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,200
The virus can then make more
copies of itself by

236
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,950
transcription of that.

237
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,610
This is a truly insidious virus
because it doesn't just

238
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,600
infect your cells and grow.

239
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,000
It infects your cells, turns
into double-stranded DNA, and

240
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,940
installs itself.

241
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,590
And how do you get that DNA
from the virus out of your

242
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,840
chromosome?

243
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,210
You don't.

244
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,480
You can't get it out.

245
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,730
It's stuck there.

246
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,820
These things, because they work
in this fashion of back

247
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,286
from RNA into DNA, have
the name retroviruses.

248
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,816
That's what these are,
retroviruses.

249
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,680
And can anyone name a particular
retrovirus?

250
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,530
STUDENT: HIV.

251
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,460
ERIC LANDER: HIV.

252
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,760
And that's how HIV works.

253
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,770
It turns out that David
Baltimore won a Nobel Prize

254
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,710
for the discovery of reverse
transcriptase.

255
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,520
And again, the reason I tell you
about all these mechanisms

256
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,250
is A, they're cool, and
they're about biology.

257
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,109
And B, they're medically
important.

258
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,780
Why is reverse transcriptase
not just cool

259
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,220
but medically important?

260
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,910
Because you could inhibit it.

261
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,390
If you wanted to fight the HIV,
if you wanted to fight

262
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,720
the AIDS virus, you could come
up with chemicals that inhibit

263
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,240
reverse transcriptase.

264
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
And of course, the cocktails
that are given to patients who

265
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,530
have been infected by HIV that
now keep them alive very, very

266
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,120
nicely include reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.

267
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,260
It's a very important thing.

268
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,260
If you understand the biology
of retroviruses, you

269
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,060
understand the targets you can
use for drug development.

270
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,600
And they have saved
billions of lives.

271
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,660
So again, I say this is not
entirely unimportant stuff.

272
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,210
This is kind of cool stuff, to
understand how this works.

273
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,990
All right.

274
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,740
Next up, transcription.

275
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,990
Let's turn to transcription.

276
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,350
Transcription is a little
bit easier.

277
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,360
Transcription varies.

278
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,810
Here, eukaryotes, prokaryotes,
and viruses.

279
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,720
Let's see, let's start
now with prokaryotes.

280
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,470
Prokaryotes, pretty simple.

281
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,840
I have a chromosome, I have my
promoter, I make my messenger

282
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,190
RNA, I'm done.

283
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,040
Just like I taught you before.

284
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,220
Transcription looks just
like I told you.

285
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,815
But for eukaryotes, it's
a little weirder.

286
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,931
Transcription, I have my RNA.

287
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,950
I have my promoter.

288
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,970
I make my RNA.

289
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,100
And my RNA, it turns out, gets
processed in all sorts of

290
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,040
interesting ways.

291
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,590
The three ways in which
eukaryotic RNA are processed--

292
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,210
first, there is a modification
put onto the five-prime end.

293
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,702
It is called--

294
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:29,930
well, it's basically a
backwards G. It's a G

295
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:35,190
triphosphate that is put on
backwards, so it goes GPPP,

296
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,140
right there.

297
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,220
And this is called a cap.

298
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,270
And it's important for message
recognition and stability.

299
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,890
Eukaryotes put a funny little
chemical modification there.

300
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,410
Eukaryotes also do something
where somewhere near the end,

301
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:55,000
they cut the message, and they
stick on a bunch of A's as a

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,900
tail at the end.

303
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,240
And this is also important for
message recognition and

304
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,010
message stability
and all that.

305
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,220
And this is called
the poly(A) tail.

306
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,870
Most of the names are
quite reasonable.

307
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,910
The tail of lots of A's is
called the poly(A) tail.

308
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,540
So eukaryotic messages have a
cap at the front, the poly(A)

309
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,590
tail at the back.

310
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,450
But the truly weird thing that
they have is, if this is my

311
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:42,980
eukaryotic message here, some
chunks of the message are cut

312
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,990
out and discarded entirely.

313
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,060
They are spliced out.

314
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,070
You might make a longer message,
and whole chunks are

315
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,600
spliced out.

316
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,435
This is called splicing.

317
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,130
Splicing throws out sequences.

318
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,200
And it could start with a long
mRNA and make it a short mRNA.

319
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,970
Now, Phil Sharp, who is on the
faculty here at MIT, won a

320
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,990
Nobel Prize some years ago for
his discovery, together with

321
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,160
someone else, of the phenomenon
of splicing.

322
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,840
So Phil is really cool.

323
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,120
You should talk to Phil.

324
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,290
This splicing involves leaving
some things in and excising

325
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,180
other things.

326
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,660
The things that are --

327
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:50,250
the things that go out
are called introns.

328
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,820
The things that stay
in and are not

329
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,265
excised are called exons.

330
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,880
The nomenclature is
a little nuts.

331
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,300
If it stays in, it's an exon.

332
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,980
If it goes out, it's
an intron.

333
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,860
As I told you, the phenomenon
was discovered by

334
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,730
Phil Sharpe at MIT.

335
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,800
The nomenclature was
proposed by Wally

336
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,780
Gilbert at Harvard, [LAUGHTER]

337
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,540
who's a good friend.

338
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm teasing Wally.

339
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm teasing Wally, but Wally
Is responsible for this

340
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,120
nomenclature that confuses
generations of students.

341
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,990
Why is this called an intron?

342
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,540
Not because it stays in,
but because it's

343
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,840
an intervening sequence.

344
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,230
It's an Intervening sequence
when it is called an intron.

345
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,840
And once something was called
an intron, the other thing

346
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,490
became an exon.

347
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,500
But I've got to say, for all
purposes, to me, in means in

348
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,970
an ex means out.

349
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,690
But it's exactly backward.

350
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,310
I've now said that
a few times.

351
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,280
That may help you remember that
it goes the other way.

352
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,680
Introns are intervening
sequences, okay?

353
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,630
So there are some pretty
impressive splicing events

354
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,850
that go on.

355
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:18,530
A typical gene, might
start off 30

356
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,360
kilobases, 30,000 bases.

357
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,220
And it might get spliced down
to 3 kilobases, 3,000 bases.

358
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,620
But for example, the Factor
VIII gene that encodes the

359
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:46,360
factor that hemophiliacs lack,
it starts off with 200

360
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,520
kilobases, 200,000 bases.

361
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,680
And all but 10,000
are cut out.

362
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,800
So it starts off 200,000, you
throw out 190,000, you get

363
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,920
down to 10.

364
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:06,520
The winner, the Duchenne
muscular dystrophy gene,

365
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,060
starts out at 2 million bases.

366
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,710
And it gets cut down
to 16,000 bases.

367
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,410
You make 2 million bases of RNA,
and you throw out almost

368
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,000
the entirety of it and
retain only 16,000.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,420
What a waste.

370
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,550
Why do this?

371
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,360
Why break up your genes in
patches of exons separated by

372
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,045
big intervening spaces and then
make a big RNA and splice

373
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,360
it together?

374
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,730
Why do something that dumb?

375
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,328
Yeah?

376
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

377
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,530
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

378
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,270
STUDENT: Are they recycled?

379
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,810
ERIC LANDER: The nucleotides,
you mean, in the RNA?

380
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,760
The nucleotides are recycled.

381
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,430
But remember, you spent the
trinucleotides there.

382
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,430
So that was an energy
expenditure.

383
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,060
Well, it turns out the
energy expenditure,

384
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,030
big deal, who cares?

385
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,160
But it turns out that this is
actually very interesting

386
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,980
evolutionarily.

387
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,630
I'll just tell you
for a second.

388
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,330
Maybe you'll forget it.

389
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,990
In a given organism,
it might be more

390
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,830
efficient to not have introns.

391
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,680
Well, actually, there's
one use for it.

392
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,050
If I had introns, the cell could
do alternative splicing.

393
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,760
It could take the same message
and splice it different ways

394
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,420
in different cells.

395
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,100
Your liver might splice
the message one

396
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,380
way to make one protein.

397
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,130
Your muscle might splice the
message a different way to

398
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,110
make another protein.

399
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,640
So you could actually
make multiple,

400
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,710
different mature messages.

401
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,400
That's cool, and that's used,
and most genes actually have

402
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,130
alternative splice forms.

403
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,810
They can be spliced up
in different ways.

404
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,200
It's also cool evolutionarily.

405
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,180
Because it turns out that if
your genes are broken up into

406
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,990
patches like that, when random
breaks happen in your genome,

407
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,930
and this bit of chromosome
attaches to that bit of

408
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,650
chromosome, as happens
sometimes--

409
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,350
you get hit by some little
radiation, it breaks

410
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,210
something, it puts
it together--

411
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,290
the gene you could have
a functioning gene.

412
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,560
Because since your cell knows
how to take a long message and

413
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,300
splice it together, the fact
that there was a break and a

414
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,520
reunion, if it happens in
one of those intervening

415
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,250
sequences, would give you
a new gene, and a

416
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,900
new functional gene.

417
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,490
And so, in fact, some people
think that this is one of the

418
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,610
tricks evolution uses to
create diversity is by

419
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,260
breaking up its information like
that into little patches

420
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,960
of files that can then be
recombined with each other in

421
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,100
different ways.

422
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,180
So those are the ideas.

423
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,700
In any case, it happens
a great deal.

424
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,537
Now, viruses.

425
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:39,700
Viruses it turns out, will
behave with regard to this

426
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,190
like the organism in
which they live.

427
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,890
Prokaryotic viruses will
behave like prokes.

428
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,860
Eukaryotic viruses will
behave like eukes.

429
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,430
Now, let's turn to
translation.

430
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,615
How does translation
work between--?

431
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:12,060
Well, now here, eukaryotes,
for the most

432
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,770
part, are well behaved.

433
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:26,210
A eukaryote makes an mRNA, it
goes to the ribosome, the mRNA

434
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,240
makes your protein, just
like I taught you.

435
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,180
But now, prokaryotes
are a little weird.

436
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:47,590
Prokaryotes, you know, their
messages are fine.

437
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,610
None of this funny cap business,
none of these

438
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,900
poly(A) tails, none
of this splicing.

439
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,690
But here's the weirdness
that prokes do.

440
00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:02,470
This mRNA, one mRNA
might encode

441
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,480
multiple different proteins.

442
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,740
Multiple proteins.

443
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,030
So this is one protein.

444
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,970
This, multiple proteins.

445
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,640
So what happens is this RNA, the
ribosome gets on here at a

446
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,780
certain site.

447
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,870
Now remember I told you the
ribosome finds the first AUG?

448
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,620
Well, it's a little
more complicated.

449
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,660
There's a particular ribosome
binding site that ribosomes

450
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,125
like to go to.

451
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:37,620
It turns out that this
prokaryotic message has

452
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,310
several of those ribosome
binding sites.

453
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,150
Ribosomes sit down.

454
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,580
They then scan for the first AUG
that they see after that

455
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,930
point and start making
a protein.

456
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,790
So I might have several
different proteins all being

457
00:28:52,790 --> 00:29:00,150
made by one messenger RNA, one
RNA making multiple proteins.

458
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,400
Why would I do that?

459
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,140
Wouldn't it be simpler, make
your head hurt less, to have

460
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,320
one gene making one protein
instead of this one mRNA

461
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,310
encoding multiple proteins?

462
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,620
STUDENT: They're related
to one another.

463
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,610
ERIC LANDER: They're related.

464
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,751
Tell me about that.

465
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,329
STUDENT: Well, like their
functions, if

466
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,460
they had similar functions.

467
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,220
ERIC LANDER: If they had similar
functions, it might be

468
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,370
very efficient to have
regulatory controls that made

469
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,410
one message.

470
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,270
And then I get all the proteins
made together, rather

471
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,340
than having separate regulatory

472
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,960
controls for each message.

473
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,890
Suppose I'm a prokaryote, and
I'm dividing very rapidly, and

474
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,510
I care about having
a small genome.

475
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,850
It might be very efficient
to do it this way.

476
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,170
So what related genes
might you put

477
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,862
together on the same message?

478
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:46,690
STUDENT: Pathway.

479
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,120
STUDENT: Same pathway.

480
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,540
Maybe if you're in charge of the
committee, you would say,

481
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,410
I would like to arrange the
genes encoding the multiple

482
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,780
steps of a biochemical
pathway.

483
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,430
And that's often what happens.

484
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,830
That's exactly what happens.

485
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:09,190
So you can get co-regulation
of genes, of

486
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,440
genes in the same pathway.

487
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,170
And such a thing, which is
called polycistronic message.

488
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,470
Polycistronic is an unhelpful
name for it, but it's what

489
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,740
they call it sometimes, or an
operon, a regulatory thing

490
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,670
that makes many such things.

491
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,280
Now, why do bacteria do it?

492
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,060
To minimize DNA.

493
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,080
They just want to use as little
space as possible.

494
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,260
So once it's invented a
regulatory control that turns

495
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,690
on this message when I want to
make arginine, well, just

496
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,410
stick all the genes on
the same message.

497
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,110
It's cheaper, simpler,
less DNA needed.

498
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,980
Now, who really has trouble
with the amount of

499
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,410
DNA they can have?

500
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,760
Do you have trouble with--

501
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,270
Is replicating your DNA a rate
limiting step in your

502
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,010
replication as an organism?

503
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,150
No.

504
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,340
What is the rate limiting
step in your organismal

505
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,564
replication, your having
offspring?

506
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:16,380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

507
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,223
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

508
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,870
STUDENT: When it comes
to an age that--

509
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,390
ERIC LANDER: It's graduating
from MIT, getting a job,

510
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,665
things like that, right?

511
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,370
And DNA replication is not rate

512
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,420
limiting, actually, right?

513
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,910
Getting a degree, all that,
that's rate limiting.

514
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,830
But for bacteria, who are
reproducing not every 20 years

515
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,970
but every 20 minutes,
DNA replication is a

516
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,890
rate limiting step.

517
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,730
It's important to their
replication.

518
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,290
And they want compact genomes.

519
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,750
You, you don't care about
a compact genome.

520
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,350
It's simply not a big metabolic
cost to you.

521
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,240
Viruses--

522
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,730
think about viruses.

523
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,940
Their genomes are tiny.

524
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,710
They're much tinier even
than prokaryotes.

525
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,040
Typical viruses might have
a few thousand or tens of

526
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,290
thousands of bases.

527
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,500
Bacteria were millions
of bases.

528
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,570
Viruses sometimes might
only have 10,000

529
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,370
letters of nucleic acid.

530
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,825
They really have to use their
information very compactly.

531
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,010
So you know what viruses
do sometimes?

532
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,690
Not all, but some?

533
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,760
Some viruses make
a messenger RNA.

534
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,070
They have a ribosome binding
site right here.

535
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,720
And they start translating
the message--

536
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,660
let's give it a sequence.

537
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:49,820
ACUUGAGCAA, and we'll put
an AUG in front of that.

538
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,810
They can start translating
here.

539
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,000
Whoops, I'm just going
to fix that.

540
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,010
But you know what?

541
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,160
There's also an AUG over here.

542
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,810
They could start
using that one.

543
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,430
And you know what else?

544
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,640
If they found another AUG
off frame, some of

545
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,580
them use that too.

546
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,370
Remember, the first AUG in
normal messages get used to

547
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,830
set the phase of the codons.

548
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,970
But in theory, I could be
reading those codons in a

549
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,540
different reading frame, shifted
over by one or shifted

550
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,180
over by two.

551
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,050
Some viruses are so clever
that they encode three

552
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,440
different proteins smack on top
of each other by reading

553
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,865
the same nucleic
acid sequence.

554
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:57,720
It shifted three
different ways.

555
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,920
It makes your head hurt to
think, how could I make a

556
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,900
functional protein?

557
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,530
I've got to manage to get three
separate functional

558
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,310
proteins built out of a single
nucleic acid sequence.

559
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,030
One, it's easy.

560
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,980
Just tell me the amino acids.

561
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,810
Now this becomes an interesting
puzzle.

562
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,190
Can I make a sequence where read
one out of frame, it also

563
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,480
makes a protein I want.

564
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,760
And another one where--

565
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,639
And some viruses have evolved
to do that, showing you how

566
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,239
much they care about economizing
their DNA.

567
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,719
All right.

568
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,820
So what have we got?

569
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,699
We have DNA replicates.

570
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,530
We've seen how it replicates.

571
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,900
Its mostly the same by nucleic
acid copying, but all these

572
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,820
variations--

573
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,889
linears, circulars, single
strand, double strand, RNA,

574
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,239
reverse transcriptase,
transcription, translation.

575
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,070
Look over these examples.

576
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,460
And what they should do is help
solidify how these things

577
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,040
work and how they're used in
slightly different fashions.

578
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,290
Next time.
