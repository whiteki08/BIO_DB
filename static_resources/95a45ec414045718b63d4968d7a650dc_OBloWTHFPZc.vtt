00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.100
HAZEL SIVE: Let's move on
with Biochemistry III.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.620
And we have, as you recall,
being exploring the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.090
fascinating and complicated
set of

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.930
macromolecules inside a cell--

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.320
inside the cell that we're
using, in a way, analogous to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.100
a factory that is a production
line for synthesis of various

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.680
components that are required for
function of the cell, for

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.580
its replication, and for
perpetuation of the organism.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.310
Today I want to talk to you
about some parameters that

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.693
surround the chemical reactions
of biochemistry.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.110
We'll talk briefly about
thermodynamics and energy

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.160
considerations.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.350
And then I want to introduce
you to a huge and pivotal

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.750
class of proteins,
the enzymes.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.400
And then we'll talk very briefly
about the currency of

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.530
energy in the cell.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.350
Let's start with thermodynamics,
which we will

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.870
define as the rules
underlying energy

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.020
usage in chemical reactions.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.310
Rules underlying energy use.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.410
And really, it's the first law
of thermodynamics that we're

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.250
interested in.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.160
We're interested in the fact
that energy is neither created

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.740
nor destroyed, that it is
converted from one form to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.220
another and that there is
conservation of energy.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.840
And the other laws are embedded
in what we'll talk,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.860
but these are the ones that
are really important for

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.110
biochemistry.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.120
Let's think about a basic
chemical reaction, some kind

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.370
of substrate.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.660
That's a biological term
which we'll use.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.180
It's equivalent to the term
"reactant." And I could use R,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.890
but I'm going to use S, because
that's what we'll use

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.950
in biochemistry, in life.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.280
And that gives rise
to a product.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.610
And chemical reactions can
go in both directions.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.690
One reaction may predominate
over the other.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.810
But the reaction
is reversible.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.220
And the questions that we're
going to ask is, does a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:41.110
chemical reaction require
or release energy?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.640
How fast does the
reaction go--

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.410
which is referred to as the
rate of the reaction.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:15.180
And how far, which refers to
the equilibrium point.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.690
Equilibrium, where equilibrium
is defined as the place where

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.940
the forward rate and the
back rate are equal.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.970
And at equilibrium, even though
the forward and the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.500
back rate are equal, it's not
that you have equal amounts of

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.580
substrate and product, you have
a particular ratio of

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.980
substrate to product that is
characteristic for the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.990
chemical reaction.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.320
So you get a specific substrate
or reactant to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.100
product ratio.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.290
Let's make this S a little
larger, to match

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.700
the P. There we go.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.310
Good.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.700
The thing that you need to
know is called Gibbs free

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.440
energy and the change in Gibbs
free energy with a reaction.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.500
So in any chemical reaction,
there are a couple of kinds of

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.580
energy considerations.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.100
The one important for us is G,
the Gibbs free energy, which

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:49.650
is the usable or, the convention
is, free energy.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.580
The other term you need
is H, which is the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.940
total energy, or enthalpy.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.655
Entropy, S, the unusable
energy.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.290
And you also need T, which is
the temperature in absolute

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.510
degrees Kelvin.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.870
And the reaction that you may
be familiar with or the

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.090
equation you may be familiar
with is delta G equals delta H

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.020
minus T delta S. And the thing
that's important here is what

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.390
this means.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:38.000
Delta G is the change
in free energy

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.365
with a chemical reaction.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.770
And every chemical reaction has
a characteristic change in

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.210
free energy.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.350
And depending on what that is,
one can say certain things

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.640
about how likely the reaction
is to proceed.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.260
If delta G is negative for a
particular chemical reaction,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:20.710
then as the reaction proceeds,
energy is released, the

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:27.460
reaction is termed exergonic,
and it is sometimes

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.810
"spontaneous." I'm going
to put that in quotes.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.060
You'll see why in a moment.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.085
The flip is true if delta
G is positive.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.990
This means that the reaction
requires energy in order to

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.640
proceed, and it is referred
to as endergonic.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.770
And if delta G is 0, the
reaction is at equilibrium.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.120
The notion that's quite useful
to think about this is balls

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.400
rolling up and down hills.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.390
For a reaction that is
exergonic, a ball rolling down

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.280
a hill will decrease its delta
G. It will release energy as

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.830
it rolls down the hill.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.590
And you can actually
plot this.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.850
And you'll see lots of plots
like this where, if you plot

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.090
energy over the course of the
reaction, you will see that

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.220
the reactants start
off at a higher

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.820
energy than the products.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.300
And as they are rolling
down the hill,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.930
there is energy released.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.060
And the flip is true for an
endergonic reaction where

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.600
delta G is positive.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.070
You have to put in energy
to get the product out.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.670
Now--

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.540
and this is where it
gets interesting.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.860
And this is where we get back
to "spontaneous" in quotes--

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.800
chemical reactions can be
exergonic, but they may not

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.850
proceed spontaneously.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.330
If you imagine a ball sitting
at the top of a hill, if the

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.440
ball is sitting right on the
slope of a hill, and you let

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.550
the ball go, it'll go zipping
down the hill, right?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.710
But if the ball is sitting on
the top of the hill, but it's

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.720
in a little hollow, it's not
going to go anywhere unless

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.030
you give a push.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.230
That's very important.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.310
And that kind of notion is
embodied in chemical

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.460
principles.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.220
So let's write this out.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.400
And then we'll formalize this.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:10.805
Delta G can be negative, but a
reaction does not proceed.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:27.780
And that's because you've got
to get the reactants out of

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.310
that little hollow at
the top of the hill.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.300
And in order to get the
reactants out of the little

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.740
hollow at the top of the hill,
you need something called

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.990
activation energy.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:47.360
Activation energy is required.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.780
I'm going to abbreviate
that AC.

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:58.836
You can abbreviate it
whatever you like.

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:02.560
And the thing about chemical
reactions that makes them

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.840
proceed in chemistry and makes
them proceed in biochemistry,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.890
in life, is that you need
something to overcome that

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.560
activation energy.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.180
Back to the ball analogy--

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.580
I think of this because
I have a dog.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.400
His name is Archer.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.920
He's a black Labrador--

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.290
in case you're interested--

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.240
and he's very fond of balls.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.500
And they sit at the top of
the hill in my yard.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.900
And there's a whole
line of them .

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.100
And they will sit there forever
unless Archer either

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.890
intelligently or by mistake
pushes one.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.270
And then it goes rolling down
the hill, and he can get it.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.860
So you have to do something
to start the reaction.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.450
You have to give energy.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.000
Where does that energy
come from?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.030
Well, it comes from somewhere.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.090
And you can decrease that
activation energy and really

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.160
get a reaction to proceed
quickly by the use of

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.070
chemicals called catalysts.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:12.640
So catalysts decrease activation
energy and allow a

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.460
reaction to proceed.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:27.230
Catalysts do not change delta G
of the whole reaction or the

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.495
equilibrium point.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.800
So you're not going
to get more.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.930
You're not going to really
change the reaction.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.140
You're just going
to get it to go.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:52.460
Catalysts do increase the
rate of reaction.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.710
That's the point.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.910
And they do this, as we'll
explore, by promoting

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.470
something called a transition
state, which is a high-energy

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.640
form of the reactants.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.310
If we go back to our ball
analogy, if you kick the ball

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.120
so that it comes up out of the
hollow, that kick that you

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.370
give the ball, the energy you
put in there, is going to get

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.040
the ball rolling down
the hill, and the

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.600
reaction will proceed.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:37.720
So catalysts promote a
transition state, which is a

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:46.065
high-energy form of
the reactants.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.170
Let's look at a couple of slides
that I drew for you.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:01.690
So here is a blank chart.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.080
And I've got delta G on the
y-axis and the reaction course

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.510
on the x-axis.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.110
And here's a reaction curve.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.000
The reaction overall is going
to have a delta G that's

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.650
negative because you see that
the products are at the bottom

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.470
of the hill, relative
to the reactants.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.320
But there's also this hump that
they have to get over.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.285
And that is what requires
activation energy.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.690
In an uncatalyzed reaction or a
catalyzed reaction, you have

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.900
to go through this high-energy
state.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.860
So here is a catalyzed reaction
that I put on as

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.630
blue, the uncatalyzed as red.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.130
And you can see what happens to
the little hill that has to

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.090
be climbed before the reaction
can proceed.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.970
The amount of energy you need to
move that chemical reaction

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.820
decreases relative to the
uncatalyzed reaction.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.830
So you decrease the little
hollow in which the ball is

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.470
sitting, in order to get the
reaction to proceed.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.700
But at the end, you'll end up
with exactly the same reaction

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.065
as you would have if it
were not catalyzed.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.260
All right.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.090
What does this have to
do with biology?

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.450
Well, it has everything.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.510
Because there's a class of
proteins that we'll talk about

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.720
for the rest of the lecture that
are biological catalysts.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.885
And without them, there
would be no life.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:41.090
So number two, we'll
talk about enzymes.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.565
And enzymes are biological
catalysts.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.900
They are usually protein.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.060
And all of the ones that we'll
talk about are proteins.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.410
But they can also be RNA.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.270
And a Nobel Prize was given
some years ago for the

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.050
discovery of RNA enzymes
that are catalysts.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.940
And Dr. Sinha has posted on
the website a video of the

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.190
Nobel lecture of Professor
Sidney Altman, who got the

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.180
Nobel Prize for the discovery
of RNAs as enzymes.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.280
But we're going to focus
on proteins.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.250
We're going to rewrite the
chemical reaction that I have

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.380
on that board in a slightly
different way, which is the

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.690
conventional way for thinking
about enzymes, where we're

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:48.250
going to have an enzyme,
abbreviated E, plus the

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.510
substrate that is
going to form an

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.020
enzyme-substrate complex.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.080
And this is the transition
state, so called

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.696
transition-state complex.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.190
And that, as I'll draw in a
moment, is going to give rise

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.680
to the enzyme plus
the product.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.560
So let me just draw
this up there.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.050
And then we'll talk about
what these mean.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:23.290
E is enzyme, S is substrate,
as previously.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:29.790
This enzyme substrate, ES, is
the transition-state complex.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.850
And what it is in biological
terms is some kind of

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.850
high-energy state of the
substrate that is linked to

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.100
the enzyme.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:18:02.060
So it's a high-energy substrate

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.310
linked to the enzyme.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.250
This transition-state complex
then resolves to release the

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.460
enzyme, which can
be used again.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.030
As in the case of all catalysts,
they can be reused

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.415
to give rise to the enzyme
and the product.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.352
So why is this interesting?

00:18:33.352 --> 00:18:34.602
It's fascinating because --

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.120
Actually, let me before I tell
you why it's so fascinating,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.370
let me show you something.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.290
So I drew this for you.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:51.370
Here is a representation of an
enzyme and something I'll

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.090
explore on the board in a moment
called the active site,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.380
where the substrate fits
into the enzyme.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.830
Here is an enzyme-substrate
complex, a high-energy

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:07.760
transition-state complex, that
undergoes reaction, catalysis,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760
to give rise to the product.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.050
The product is released,
and you start

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.460
the whole thing again.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.160
The thing about biological
catalysts that are really

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.700
different from chemical
catalysts is their

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.190
specificity.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.640
Now, you may have heard of
platinum as a catalyst.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.900
Platinum is an incredibly
powerful catalyst that

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.220
promotes almost any
chemical reaction

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.270
that involves hydrogen--

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.870
but any chemical reaction.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.260
The difference between platinum
and enzymes is that

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.870
enzymes are incredibly specific
for a particular

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.270
chemical reaction.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.530
Let's write that.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:20:06.130
Enzymes are highly specific,
exquisitely specific, for the

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:07.380
particular reaction.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.270
And they maintain this
specificity by fitting the

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.890
substrate into what I've got
on the screen there, the

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.230
active site, which is a
particular part of the enzyme,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.890
a particular part
of the protein.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:35.250
And the deal is that the
substrate fits into a part of

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.240
the protein called
the active site.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.830
The active site is a very small
part of the protein.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.110
And it's this interaction with
the protein and the active

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.545
site that promotes the
transition state.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.610
How does it promote the
transition state?

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.610
Well, you can think physically
it might change the shape of

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.180
the substrate to make
it higher energy.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.440
You could imagine
it adds charge.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.600
You could imagine it adds
particular orientation between

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.540
two substrate molecules
that happen to be

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.600
in the active site.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.560
Or it might align the substrate
in the correct way.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.420
So we can actually say that the
substrate is promoted to

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:39.920
undergo catalysis
by controlling--

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.940
let's just list these--

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.550
orientation of the substrate
in the access site, adding

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:53.520
strain to the substrate, or
possibly adding a particular

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.700
charge to the substrate.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.640
Let's look through a couple
of things here.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.780
Okay, this is from your book.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.330
Let's not dwell on that.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.780
Let's go to this one,
which is not quite--

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.560
Ah, it's on that screen.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.400
Good.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.010
This is an example of enzyme
specificity that you see every

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.680
day, probably.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.570
On Diet Coke, it says,
"warning, fennel

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.440
phenylketonurics, contains

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.640
phenylalanine." What's the deal?

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.480
There is a disorder called
phenylketonuria where people

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.220
are unable to digest the amino
acid phenylalanine.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.730
This is an essential
amino acid, but too

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.420
much of it is bad.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.820
Normally when you eat
phenylalanine, you use some of

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.970
it to build proteins.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.070
That's good.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.070
But then you convert a bunch
of it, using this enzyme

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.990
called phenylalanine
hydroxylase, into tyrosine,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.660
which you may remember is
another amino acid.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.730
And then you use tyrosine.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.130
And tyrosine goes on to do
a bunch of other things.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.090
If this enzyme is absent, then
you get a side product whereby

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.830
the excess phenylalanine
makes this stuff called

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.770
phenylpyruvic acid.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.620
And that is a neurotoxin.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.160
And it poisons the nervous
system, and people have very

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.150
severe symptoms.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:25.690
People with phenylketonuria
generally have a single amino

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.790
acid change in an enzyme that
is more than 1,000 amino

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.390
acids, where there's an arginine
that has being

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.850
changed to a tryptophan.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.930
And the single amino
acid change lies

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.620
in the active site.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.600
It stops the phenylalanine from
binding the active site.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.480
And it leads to this really
debilitating disorder.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.770
And so that's an everyday
example of a single tiny

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:58.180
change that reflects
the specificity of

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.430
the particular enzyme.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.520
But here's a puzzle.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.210
This is a space-filling
model of an enzyme,

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.200
taken from your book.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.730
Here's a substrate in red.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.930
And you can see that this
enzyme has 3D shape.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.210
Each of these bubbles is part
of one of the amino acids.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.900
That's what a space-filling
model is.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.980
And the substrate fits into
this active site.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.590
I think this is called
hexokinase.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.120
And you can see as the substrate
enters the active

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.310
site, actually the protein
changes shape.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.630
And it kind of closes up and
contains the substrate in the

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.410
active site.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.100
And catalysis takes place.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.130
But the active site is tiny.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.630
And there's this huge
rest of the protein.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.940
And you can't get rid of the
rest of the protein.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.920
The enzyme doesn't function
if you do.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.680
So there's a fundamental
question that we need to ask,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.820
which is, what do the rest of
proteins do, the part outside

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.070
the active site?

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.180
So let's ask that question.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:34.750
What does the rest of the
protein, which is large, do?

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.960
And by the rest of the protein,
I mean "not the

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:45.880
active site," which is the place
where the transition

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.900
state complex is promoted.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:55.220
What it does is to regulate the
activity of the enzyme.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.270
So the answer we can give
is that it regulates, or

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.945
controls, activity
of the enzyme.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.460
What do I mean?

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.060
Well, if you go back to this
notion of the cell as a

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.840
factory and enzymes as the
wheels and the machines that

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.740
get things done so that you
get particular components

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.415
synthesized, then you really
want to make sure that you

00:26:25.415 --> 00:26:28.860
have got your production line
working at the right pace.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.860
If you need more product,
you need to speed up.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.910
If you need less product,
you need to slow down.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.030
The enzymes are a place where
you control how much product

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.360
is being made, how much reactant
is being used, how

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.500
much substrate is being used.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.250
So the rest of the protein
controls the

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.750
activity of the enzyme.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.010
And there are a couple of ways
that this activity is

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.380
controlled.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:04.500
The end result is that all of
these regulations affect the

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:11.260
active site, even if they
happen far, far away.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.000
And so you can imagine that if
you are all lined up in a

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.700
line, and the active site was
right at the front of the line

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.250
of you that was the enzyme
prototype, and I pushed you,

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.860
and you all fell down, the
active site, the very front of

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.460
the line, would eventually be
affected although I'd pushed

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.020
the back of the line.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.970
It's a silly example, but it
gives you a sense of how you

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.160
can change one thing and it
has an effect far away.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.930
And the way that this is done
is through the use of

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.170
inhibitors.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.440
I'll go through some
slides in a moment.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.030
And there are two kinds
of inhibitors.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.790
There are reversible inhibitors,
and there are

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.050
irreversible inhibitors.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.570
These inhibitors may be
competitive inhibitors.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.170
If they are competitive, they
actually will bind to the

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:24.930
active site as opposed to
the rest of the protein.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:34.470
But if they are all of a class
that is non-competitive, they

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.325
will bind to the protein
elsewhere.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.610
I'll show you a slide
in a minute.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.370
But let's finish doing
some board work

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.700
here before I do that.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.920
There is also a very important
and interesting class of

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.750
enzyme regulators called
allosteric regulators.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:04.210
There are both allosteric
activators of enzyme function

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:11.250
or inhibitors, things that will
increase or decrease the

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.040
rate of the reaction.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.540
And these allosteric activators
or inhibitors will

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:22.170
bind to a particular site that's
not the active site.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.380
It's called an allosteric
site--

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.060
not the active site, but another
particular place on

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.310
the enzyme.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.840
Other things that can change
enzyme function--

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.690
pH, the enzymes that work in
your stomach to digest your

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.750
food work at a pH of 2.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.310
That's the pH in your stomach.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.730
It's very acid.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.930
Those enzymes will not work in
your small intestine, which is

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.430
at a pH of about 6 or 7.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:02.940
So pH, physiologically, can
affect how enzymes work.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:10.680
Temperature affects
how enzymes work.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.100
And all of these things are
somehow changing the structure

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.440
of the protein.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.260
And changing the structure
of the protein is

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.520
changing its function.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.090
We'll explore this in more
specifics as the semester goes

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.390
by, but this is what you
need to understand now.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:33.710
There are also classes of
molecules called cofactors,

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.685
coenzymes, and prosthetic
groups.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.270
I'll go through one of
these in a moment.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.750
But all of these things
have the outcome--

00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:06.320
all change the structure of the
protein so they'll change

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.570
enzyme structure.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.115
And with that, they will
change enzyme function.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.900
So all of these things--

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.550
I'm going to put it in a box--

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.370
change the structure
of the protein.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.450
They will change the structure
of the enzyme,

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.830
of the active site.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.690
And they will change
its function.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.220
And they're very complicated
to think about.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.445
Let's go through some slides
that will help us with this.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.920
Here's the notion of a
competitive inhibitor.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.750
Here's the substrate
and an active site.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.050
And here's an inhibitor.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.820
And you can see I've drawn it so
that it kind of looks like

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.990
a substrate, but it's got
some extra stuff.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.530
And so when it binds to the
active site, it binds

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.960
specifically.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.250
But it's not actually a
substrate, because it's got

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.490
this extra chemical moiety
which does not make it

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.270
available for catalysis.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.480
And that stops the enzyme.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.770
That competitive inhibitor may
or may not be able to come off

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.970
the enzyme and allow
it to work again.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.180
It depends on the inhibitor.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.480
Here's another one, a
noncompetitive inhibitor that

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.080
doesn't look like a substrate
and binds somewhere else on

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.450
the enzyme and, in doing so,
changes the shape of the

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.800
active site.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.730
So the active site now can't
bind the substrate anymore

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.260
because its shape has
being changed.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.710
Here's the notion of an
allosteric activator.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.850
Here's the enzyme, and here's
the enzyme with its substrate.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.620
And here's its allosteric
site.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.600
And it can't work until an
allosteric activator, which is

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.620
not the substrate--

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.230
it's a different molecule--

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.080
binds to the allosteric site and
then makes the active site

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.270
the correct shape to fit
the substrate so that

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.720
the enzyme can work.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.170
And you can get a cycle here
again, so that you get

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.260
catalysis, and the whole thing
can take place again.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.120
I want to show you, to give
you a sense of the kind of

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.390
complexity of what this all
looks like, a particular

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.870
example of an enzyme reaction.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.930
And I'll show you an animation
that goes with this, to give

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.040
you a sense of how these
things work.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.850
The enzyme I'm going to
focus on is called

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.980
dihydrofolate reductase.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.380
That's an essential enzyme.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.530
It's required for nucleotide
synthesis, DNA modification.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.100
And the reason you take folate,
or folic acid, is to

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.500
allow dihydrofolate to
actually work --

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.570
dihydrofolate reductase
to work.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.850
The substrate is
dihydrofolate.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.560
It's a complicated molecule.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.490
But I've circled the
important part.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.770
You can see there's a double
bond here which is going to be

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.560
reduced when the enzyme acts.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.060
And here is the reduced form
or tetrahydrofolate of

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.540
dihydrofolate reductase.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.880
You don't need to take
notes on this.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.570
Just look and listen.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.690
Here is a structure
of the protein.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.989
You can see the alpha helices
in brown and the beta sheets

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.760
in blue and this kind
of unstructured

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.280
loopy stuff in between.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.129
And here is the substrate
dihydrofolate binding to its

00:34:38.129 --> 00:34:39.570
active site.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.739
Dihydrofolate reductase requires
a coenzyme, something

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.719
called NADPH, which is a very
important coenzyme.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.420
It's also part of the energy
production cycle.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.739
And dihydrofolate reductase is
not only essential for life

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.040
but it's a target of the
anticancer drug methotrexate

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.205
and of trimethoprim, which
is an antibiotic.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.150
This is an animation which
will show you how

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:11.380
dihydrofolate binds to
dihydrofolate reductase, how

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:16.840
NADPH comes in, and how NADPH
donates the hydrogens that

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.750
will allow dihydrofolate
to be reduced.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.890
So let me start the animation,
and I'll point things out as

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.090
you're watching it.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.830
And you'll see it's quick.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.750
Here is the coenzyme
coming in.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:36.540
And here is the substrate
dihydrofolate.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.230
And if you look at it, you'll
see that the coenzyme is near

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.130
the active site.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:46.690
And as it binds first, donates
its hydrogens to

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:52.070
dihydrofolate, which then
becomes tetrahydrofolate, is

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.010
released from the enzyme.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.860
There are a number of things
you can see here.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.730
You can see the enzyme cycle.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.610
You can see this goes
over and over again.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.050
You can see that the
enzyme, the protein

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.570
structure, is changing.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.400
It's moving as the coenzyme
is binding, as the

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.250
substrate is binding.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.000
You can see that there's a
chemical reaction going on

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.270
here as the NADPH is giving
its hydrogens to this

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.760
dihydrofolate.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.240
And you can get a sense
of the kind of

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.440
animation that is enzymes.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.830
This is an animation.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.580
No one's actually seen an enzyme
work like this because

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.460
it's impossible to take
real movies like this.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.190
But based on the structure of
the enzyme and the binding of

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.910
NADPH and the substrate to the
enzyme, these authors have

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.480
reconstructed this really
beautiful movie which gives

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.560
you a sense how enzymes
work in action.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:46.950
Okay.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.410
I'll post this on
your website.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.660
And you can watch it.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:37:00.210
The last two things I want to
tell you are that, firstly,

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.520
enzymes don't work
as one-off deals.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.410
They work as part of
a production line.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.430
And the production line
is called a pathway.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.070
And like any good production
line, as I've mentioned

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.360
already, there are checks and
balances to make sure that the

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.190
production line is working at
optimal speed and making what

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.530
it needs to make.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:27.756
So we can talk about pathways
and feedback.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.000
And let's draw a simple pathway
on the board to give

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.960
you a sense of what I mean.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.030
Let's start off with a substrate
that's converted

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:47.390
through the action of enzyme
one to product one.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:51.670
And then there is also a
competing pathway where this--

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.290
Actually, lets make
it product one.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.885
Or we can call it
substrate two.

00:37:56.885 --> 00:38:01.080
But let's call it product one,
and then through the action of

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.230
enzyme two, to product one.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.890
And here's a competing pathway
where the substrate, through

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.560
the action of enzyme three makes
product three, and then

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.340
through enzyme four action,
makes product four.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.410
Okay.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.400
This is a pathway.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.660
It's a bifurcating pathway.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:29.430
It may be that's if you've got
this branch, the E3-E4 branch

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.020
of the pathway active, you
actually want to shut off

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.560
production of the
other pathway.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.880
And it may be that if you get
product four made, you

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.950
actually want to shut off
production of product two.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.820
In that case, you could draw a
line like this-- you could

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.440
make it up, whatever you like.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.110
But for the example I'm giving
you, I'm telling you that when

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.910
you've got lots of product four,
it's going to shut off

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.370
the other branch
of the pathway.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:09.000
And this nomenclature
is as follows.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.955
An arrow means activate.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.840
And what's called a T-bar
means inhibit.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.570
And these are very standard
nomenclatures in biology that

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.270
you should know.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.820
So this T-bar here is inhibit.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.730
It's also called negative
feedback.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.000
At the same time, you might
get positive feedback.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.580
It may be that if you have some
of product three, you

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.570
actually want more
of product one.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:54.390
And in that case, product three
might activate enzyme

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.180
one so that you actually
activate the other branch.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.790
This is a complicated pathway.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.510
There's a lot of competition
going on here.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:08.420
But in that case, that
activation would be positive.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:13.300
And so for this example,
my star

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.635
would be positive feedback.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:25.470
And my T-bar, which I'll make
a pound sign, would be a

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.720
negative feedback.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.610
This is a really pivotal
concept in biology.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.570
It's not just true of enzyme
pathways, it's true of

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.790
multiple chemical reactions.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.650
And you really need
to understand

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.790
this aspect of biology.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:47.000
The last thing that I want to
tell you has to do, very

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.300
briefly, with where the energy
comes from that cells use for

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.500
chemical reactions.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.300
And what I'm going to tell you
very briefly, in about two

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.020
seconds, is that in the cell,
there are very controlled

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.570
amounts of energy that are
contained in a nucleotide

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.880
called ATP.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:15.350
ATP is a nucleotide
triphosphate.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.030
We talked about nucleotides
before.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:23.440
The triphosphate is very
important here.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:30.110
And this nucleotide triphosphate
is kind of like

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.600
the dollars and cents of energy
currency in the cell.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.760
If a chemical reaction needs
energy, the cell

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.390
uses ATP to get it.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:50.890
ATP is hydrolyzed to give rise
to ADP, adenosine diphosphate,

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:57.060
and PPI, inorganic phosphate,
plus an increment of energy.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.090
This is an exergonic reaction.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:12.340
This energy is then used for
chemical reactions, to build

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.600
or to break down various
molecules.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.210
For this reaction, delta
G is negative.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.425
That is why there's
energy released.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.860
And this energy is used for
two types of reactions--

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:42.600
those that are catabolic, that
break down molecules, and

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:52.320
those that are anabolic, which
build up molecules.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.340
We're not going to talk about
generation of ATP.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.640
That is a separate topic.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.640
And those of you who are go on
to do biochemistry will talk

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.620
about it in great detail.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:06.530
But I do have some slides on
here that I will refer to.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.635
Here is --

00:43:06.635 --> 00:43:08.820
This is the last thing
I'll show you.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.140
Please wait for it.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.800
Here is adenosine
triphosphate.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.350
Here is the high-energy
bond that is

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.470
broken to release energy.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.720
And we'll stop there.
