1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,160
HAZEL SIVE: Another truism of
biochemistry is that many of

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,870
the molecules within cells
are very large.

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,940
And they're called

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,700
macromolecules, to indicate this.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,950
So macromolecules.

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,680
So these are often --

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,540
Biological molecules are
often macromolecules.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,225
And these macromolecules
are often polymers--

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,600
not always--

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,830
where a polymer is some
kind of repeat of

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,435
a monomer "n" times.

12
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,030
And in formation of
macromolecules, there are two

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,970
kinds of reactions that
you need to know.

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,820
They are called condensation
and hydrolysis reactions.

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,240
And they go something
like this.

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,395
Condensation reactions
form bonds.

17
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,230
Hydrolysis reactions
break bonds.

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,050
And condensation reactions
go something like this.

19
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,120
If we call the monomer M, there
would be a monomer with

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,730
a hydroxyl group that interacts
with another monomer

21
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,950
that has a hydroxyl group.

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:12,130
And the outcome of that would
be a bond between the two

23
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,390
monomers, with the
release of water.

24
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,450
And the flip of that, during
a hydrolysis reaction, is

25
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,340
exactly the opposite, where this
dimonomer here, M-O-M,

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,030
where there's an ether bond
between the two monomers as

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,550
I've drawn it, called different
things-- we'll talk

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,550
about that--

29
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,050
adds water and then is broken
down into two monomers.

30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,220
And so you should know a
condensation and a hydrolysis

31
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,900
reaction, because every reaction
that we talk about in

32
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,780
this course and in much of
biochemistry involves either

33
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,800
condensation or hydrolysis
reactions.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,540
Often, both condensation or
hydrolysis require energy,

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,290
sometimes that they
release it.

36
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:17,145
So often, both often require
energy in order to proceed.

37
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:18,395
Okay.

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,410
Very good.

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,900
Let's move then to the second
topic that I'd like to discuss

40
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,030
today, which is the
first big class of

41
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,500
macromolecules, the lipids.

42
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,020
Lipids are a fascinating
class of macromolecules

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,790
essential for life.

44
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:06,780
They comprise about 5% of the
dry mass of a cell, the dry

45
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,530
mass referring to the mass
remaining after the water has

46
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,070
been removed.

47
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,700
And lipids are crucial--

48
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,290
and we discussed this briefly
last lecture--

49
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,079
for formation of the membranes
around the cell and around the

50
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,080
various organelles.

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,640
So lipids are required
for membranes.

52
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,780
They also serve as major energy
stores for the cells.

53
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,280
Their bonds are very
energy rich.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,080
They are also involved in
various signaling processes.

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
We'll touch on this today
and later in the course.

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,710
And of course, they are involved
in insulation, both

57
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,590
in keeping the whole organism
warm-- if it's an animal,

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,780
during winter--

59
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,560
but also in insulating nerve
cells as nerve cells transmit

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,900
their signals by insulating
them, kind of like an

61
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,970
electrical wire is insulated
by plastic.

62
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,210
The condensation reactions
that form during lipid

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,600
formation often involve
synthesis of things called

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,810
triglycerides.

65
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,580
And triglycerides are formed
from glycerol.

66
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,540
And I'm going to warn you that
my chemical structures are

67
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,580
going to be casual.

68
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,090
We assume that you have enough
chemistry that if you know

69
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,700
that I write CH2OH, you
actually know that the

70
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,320
hydrogens are sticking out
around the carbon.

71
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,470
Okay?

72
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,460
That's my contract with you.

73
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,770
We assume you know enough
chemistry to deal with that.

74
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,440
If you don't, then please come
and see me or Dr. Sinha.

75
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,710
And to that glycerol is
added a fatty acid.

76
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:16,050
And the fatty acid has got a
hydroxyl group attached to a

77
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:24,490
carbonyl, which is attached to
a long-chain hydrocarbon,

78
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,440
where n is 16 to 20.

79
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,770
And this guy here is called
a fatty acid.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,200
And out of the addition of
glycerol and the fatty acid--

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,670
I'm going to put a line between
the two so that you

82
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,920
can see the difference--

83
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,340
comes something called
a triglyceride.

84
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,200
And I'm going to draw this for
just one of the glycerol

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
carbon atoms.

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,840
And then the same thing is
true for all the others.

87
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,320
So you'll have CH2 at
the end, and then a

88
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,740
condensation reaction.

89
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,950
And we're going to write et
cetera here, being casual

90
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,140
about this.

91
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,530
And out of this comes
this triglyceride.

92
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:49,130
This reaction is a condensation
reaction.

93
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,380
It eliminates water.

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,220
It's a condensation reaction.

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:10,160
And it's also a
transesterification, where you

96
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,300
can see the ester bond formed
in the triglyceride.

97
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm going to notate
triglycerides in a slightly

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,110
different way.

99
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,170
I'll show you this
in a moment.

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,260
But let's take a look at a
picture here so you can see

101
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,250
what it actually looks like.

102
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,100
Here's glycerol,
from your book.

103
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,799
And here is a fatty acid.

104
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,580
And here are the reactive
species interacting to give

105
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,760
you a condensation reaction and
joining up the glycerol to

106
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,580
the fatty acid.

107
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,290
And the glycerol then serves
as a backbone to have these

108
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,470
three chains of fatty acid.

109
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,690
Hence the name triglycerides.

110
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,490
Lipids are not, strictly
speaking, polymers.

111
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,440
And so what I said about
macromolecules being polymers

112
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,860
really doesn't hold
for lipids.

113
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,890
But the other principles do.

114
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,400
One of the things about lipids
is that they can be modified.

115
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,720
And they can be modified by
replacing one of the fatty

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,540
acid chains with something
that is polar.

117
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,340
So if you look at this
triglyceride, you can see at a

118
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,260
glance that it is really
hydrogens and carbons.

119
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,510
It's very non-polar.

120
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,680
There's a couple of
oxygens up here.

121
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,840
But there are so few relative
to the molecule that really

122
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,950
this is a very non-polar
molecule.

123
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,500
But you can change the
properties of lipids in an

124
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,410
extraordinary way by replacing
one of the fatty acid chains

125
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,860
with something polar.

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,415
And that is particularly
done in phospholipids.

127
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,110
And we're going to now draw a
triglyceride in a different

128
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:17,690
way, in shorthand, where the
glycerol is going to have a

129
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,190
horizontal bar and the fatty
acid chains are going to

130
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,070
emanate as vertical lines.

131
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,380
The triglyceride, your classic
one, is hydrophobic because it

132
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,630
is non-polar.

133
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,820
But you can also take one of
those side chains, or one of

134
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,290
those fatty acid chains,
and replace it

135
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,040
with a phosphate group.

136
00:10:49,040 --> 00:11:02,500
So you can replace one fatty
acid with a phosphate, which

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,070
is highly charged.

138
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:14,960
And then you get something like
this, where the blob is

139
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,070
the phosphate group.

140
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,030
Phospholipids are the things
which make cell membranes.

141
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,300
And they make cell membranes
because they are on one end

142
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,420
polar, and on the other
end they're non-polar.

143
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,040
And so here on the top end,
they are polar and

144
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,540
hydrophilic.

145
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,340
And then the bottom
part is non-polar.

146
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:51,820
And this causes them to
self-associate so that the

147
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,670
polar groups face water
and the non-polar

148
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,410
groups face one another.

149
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,230
And these will spontaneously
form a lipid bilayer, the

150
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,070
thing that surrounds all of
the cell and all of the

151
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,270
organelles.

152
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,610
So they will go and
spontaneously associate into a

153
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:37,130
bilayered membrane, which we can
draw like this, using our

154
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,350
shorthand notation.

155
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,380
And what I've done is to now
put the hydrophobic or the

156
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,465
non-polar bits facing
one another.

157
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,240
And these polar bits are now
interacting with water.

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,490
So these are hydrophilic--

159
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,100
which I'm going to hyphenate.

160
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,810
And they are indeed interacting
with water.

161
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,630
Let's look at some pictures
to exemplify this.

162
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,830
Here is the chemical structure
of a phospholipid.

163
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,790
They're the long-chain
fatty acids.

164
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,290
And here's the phosphate
group.

165
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,570
This is actually a modified
phosphate group.

166
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,380
It's got a choline moiety,
which makes

167
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,600
it even more polar.

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,200
And here you go with this
little bit sticking out.

169
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,890
So you can see the shape of
the molecule has changed.

170
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,100
And also its electronegativity
has changed.

171
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,900
And here are these molecules
that spontaneously form this

172
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,220
lipid bilayer, the phospholipid
membrane, with

173
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,780
all the hydrophilic parts
sticking out and touching

174
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,480
water on either side and the
hydrophobic parts interacting

175
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,470
with one another.

176
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,950
I want to really make
a point that this is

177
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,720
not a double membrane.

178
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,890
This is a single membrane.

179
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,900
We talked last time about
mitochondria and the nucleus

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,170
having double membranes
around them.

181
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,060
That would be two of these.

182
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,000
This thing that we've got up
here is a single membrane.

183
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,710
This is what all cell membranes
and organelle

184
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,530
membranes look like.

185
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,005
That's an important
thing to realize.

186
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,486
The last thing I want
to mention --

187
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,150
Actually, the last thing
I want to mention about

188
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,230
triglycerides is that there
are a couple of different

189
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,470
kinds of triglyceride
chains which are

190
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,540
very important medically.

191
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,720
And you've heard of them.

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:45,850
There are saturated fats, where
the triglyceride chains

193
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,910
have got all single
carbon atoms.

194
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,280
And all of these completely
saturated--

195
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,220
in other words, there
are no double bonds.

196
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,000
Triglycerides with these
types of chains

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,265
tend to pack tightly.

198
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,750
And this gives them the property
of chemical stability

199
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,525
and confers on them a
high melting point.

200
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,830
So saturated fats
are often solid.

201
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,840
And this is bad.

202
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,980
These are bad for you.

203
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,070
In contrast, unsaturated fats
are sometimes good for you and

204
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,600
sometimes not.

205
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:53,020
So unsaturated fats all
have, somewhere, a

206
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,880
carbon double bond.

207
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,150
There are two kinds of
unsaturated fats.

208
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:05,520
There are cis-unsaturated
fats, where--

209
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,150
let's just put in some
extra bonds here--

210
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,160
where the other bonds that are
available to the carbons are

211
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
on the same side of
the molecule.

212
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,980
And you remember that there's
no free rotation around a

213
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,100
double bond.

214
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,720
So if that molecule looks like
that, it is stuck that way.

215
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,670
If it synthesized that way,
it's stuck that way.

216
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:46,420
On the other hand, there are
trans-unsaturated fats, where

217
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,050
the additional valencies of
carbon are on opposite sides

218
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,850
of the molecule.

219
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,960
Cis fats--

220
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,050
I'll show you a slide
in a moment--

221
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,550
so these have got
double bonds.

222
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,680
The cis fats pack poorly because
they are kinked.

223
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,144
And these have got a
low melting point.

224
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,369
And these are good for you.

225
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,150
The trans-fats, however, are
much more like the saturated

226
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,155
fats, and they pack tightly, et
cetera, high melting point.

227
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,170
And they are particularly
bad for you.

228
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,900
Trans-fats are very seldom
found in nature.

229
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,060
They are found in Twinkies
and other gourmet treats.

230
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,250
All right, let's look
at some structures

231
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,230
here from your book.

232
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,380
Saturated fats, you can see the
chains are all straight,

233
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,430
and they pack very tightly.

234
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,810
Cis-unsaturated fats, here's a
bend in the chain, and this

235
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,470
makes the molecules
pack loosely.

236
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,970
This is a steric, a spatial,
consideration.

237
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,930
And then if you look at
trans and cis fats,

238
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,000
here's oleic acid.

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,120
It's the same carbon chain.

240
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,690
But trans-oleic acid has
a straight chain,

241
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,770
cis-oleic has a bend.

242
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,080
They're both unsaturated fats.

243
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,510
And the question that I am sure
you have seen is whether

244
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,270
or not trans fat should be
removed from all food, and how

245
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,300
that can be done, and why
it is bad for you.

246
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,850
And now it's required that there
are ingredients posted

247
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,290
on various food so that you
know what you're eating.

248
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,200
And I'm going to tell you a
little bit about why trans fat

249
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,410
is bad for you.

250
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,640
But I have to introduce to you
another lipid and another

251
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,880
class of lipids in
order to do so.

252
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,040
And that's not the only reason
that I'm going to introduce

253
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,430
this other class of lipids.

254
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,360
I'm going to do it because it's
a very important class.

255
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,150
So a second class of lipids that
we should consider beyond

256
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,643
the triglycerides are
the steroids.

257
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:26,070
Steroids share a common
ring structure.

258
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,910
They are lipids with a common
ring structure.

259
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:44,410
And I have the slide up so you
can look at it even now.

260
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,820
Their precursor is
cholesterol.

261
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,420
And cholesterol is,
in fact, not bad.

262
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,140
It is an essential lipid.

263
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,000
And it's essential both for
formation of the membrane, and

264
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,060
all membranes, and it is also
crucial for signaling.

265
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,580
And if an organism develops
without cholesterol, it

266
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,650
develops with one eye.

267
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,060
You lack the whole midline that
divides you into two more

268
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,610
or less bilaterally
symmetric parts.

269
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,140
So cholesterol is a very
essential component.

270
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,570
Other things that come from
lipids are vitamin D, much in

271
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,450
the news also with regard to
preventing inflammation, and

272
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,700
various hormones.

273
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Their structure's on the
board -- on the screen.

274
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,640
And you can see, in green, the
common ring structure with

275
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,610
various other groups attached,
which give these different

276
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,660
steroidal lipids their
particular structures.

277
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,850
And we'll come back to the
notion of cholesterol and why

278
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,360
it's both essential but--
let me annotate here--

279
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,340
too much is bad.

280
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,590
All right.

281
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,570
In the news a lot are steroids
androgens, a particular class

282
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,560
of artificial androgens
are normal steroids.

283
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,200
But there is a class of
artificial steroids.

284
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,930
Here's one,
tetrahydrogestrinone, which is

285
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,490
used by athletes.

286
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,290
It is mostly undetectable.

287
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,700
The tests for anabolic steroids
used by athletes are

288
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,340
actually very high tech.

289
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,830
And this one is very difficult
to detect.

290
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,560
And it makes the question of
whether particular athletes

291
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,610
have used steroids rather
difficult to answer

292
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,860
unequivocally.

293
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,736
Too much cholesterol --

294
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:03,850
I should be using the screen.

295
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,000
Too much cholesterol leads
to a condition called

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,450
atherosclerosis, where
cholesterol is deposited in

297
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,850
the arteries.

298
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,900
Here it is.

299
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,100
And this literally physically
blocks up the artery, causes

300
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,580
the blood to clot, and leads
to heart attacks.

301
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,500
And here's an artery
that's OK--

302
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,340
well, actually it's
not quite, there.

303
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,490
You can see it's being injected
with contrast, and

304
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,060
there's a little place
where it's not OK.

305
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,400
And here's one which is
completely occluded by an

306
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,090
atherosclerotic plaque.

307
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,990
What's the deal with
cholesterol?

308
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,960
Cholesterol is used for
membranes and signalling.

309
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,360
But it also is carried through
the body by a component called

310
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,370
low-density lipoprotein.

311
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,910
And this low-density
lipoprotein, or LDL, is

312
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,430
deposited in the arteries, where
it plugs them and leads

313
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,550
to heart attack.

314
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,510
If cholesterol binds
high-density lipoproteins, a

315
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,970
different kind of a transport
molecule, then the excess

316
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,400
cholesterol is excreted by the
liver, and you're good.

317
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,760
You're well.

318
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,870
Turns out, through complicated
reasons, that trans fat and

319
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,960
saturated fat increases the
levels of this bad,

320
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,500
low-density lipoprotein
and thereby

321
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,140
increases heart attacks.

322
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,750
I should note that most
cholesterol is made by you.

323
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,990
80% of your cholesterol
is made by you.

324
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,740
20% you get from food.

325
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,780
So eating a low cholesterol diet
usually doesn't do much

326
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,150
for cholesterol levels.

327
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,170
You actually have to interfere
with synthesis, which is what

328
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,080
the various drugs called
statins do.

329
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,390
All right.

330
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,840
So enough about lipids.

331
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,210
Let us move to our third topic
today, another fascinating and

332
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,690
important set of macromolecules,
the

333
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,940
carbohydrates.

334
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,380
Carbohydrates make up
about 25% of the dry

335
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,940
mass of a cell .

336
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:14,370
They're used as an energy
source, as a carbon source to

337
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,620
build other molecules.

338
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,600
And they also encode
information, as in your blood

339
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,256
type, which I will try to touch
on in a few moments.

340
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:33,270
Their chemical formula is much
simpler and is polymeric,

341
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,520
unlike the lipids.

342
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:45,670
(CH2O)n, or if you like, more
informatively, (H-C-OH)n.

343
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,240
And because of the hydroxyl
group, carbohydrates are

344
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,995
pretty much always
hydrophilic.

345
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,760
The monomer of carbohydrates
is called a monosaccharide.

346
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,460
And there can be polymers
that are two

347
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,330
monomers or multiple monomers.

348
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,370
So the monomer--

349
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,580
and you should know this--

350
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,300
is called a monosaccharide,
where

351
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,590
saccharide sounds like saccharin.

352
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,840
That means sugar.

353
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,850
And there can be dimers, which
would be a small polymer,

354
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,800
which would be a disaccharide.

355
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,860
And then you can also get long
sugars, which would be

356
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,110
polysaccharides.

357
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,390
A monosaccharide, for example,
would be glucose.

358
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,640
A disaccharide, sucrose.

359
00:25:51,640 --> 00:26:00,340
And a polysaccharide, glycogen
in animals or

360
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,355
cellulose in plants.

361
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,210
All right.

362
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,520
Let's look at the condensation
reaction that is responsible

363
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,390
for making carbohydrates.

364
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,580
It's a simple condensation
reaction, at

365
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,540
least on the board.

366
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,090
It requires careful
orchestration by the cell, but

367
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,920
on the board it's
easy to draw.

368
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:35,506
One carbohydrate plus another
carbohydrate--

369
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm not going to put all the
side groups on, but you

370
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,900
understand there are other side
groups here or another

371
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,530
carbon there, giving rise to--

372
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,780
with the release of water.

373
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,650
So here is a condensation
reaction.

374
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,770
And this bond that forms
in carbohydrates--

375
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm actually going to add the
next carbons on here, instead

376
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,100
of X. I apologize for erasing
here, but let's put some

377
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,710
carbons here rather than X
because that will be clearer.

378
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,340
But the bond between two
monomers is called a

379
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,910
glycosidic bond.

380
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,810
And that designates that it
is found in carbohydrates.

381
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,260
Carbohydrates can isomerize.

382
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,800
That means the same chemical
formula can change its shape,

383
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:02,620
can change the organization of
its atoms, and can isomerize

384
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:08,015
between the ring and
a linear structure.

385
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,910
And carbohydrates can
also be modified.

386
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,680
They remain hydrophilic in
general, but there are many

387
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,570
modifications which are rather
crucial to their function.

388
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,710
They can get, for example,
phosphate

389
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,930
groups or amino groups.

390
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,480
And this will change their
particular properties.

391
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,600
Let's look at some slides.

392
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,220
And then I want to tell you
about a very fascinating and

393
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,070
important example of
carbohydrates as an

394
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,500
information source.

395
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,840
So here's glucose as straight
chain and glucose as a ring.

396
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,880
If you're not familiar with
looking at chemical

397
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,740
structures--

398
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,930
I keep forgetting that
is my usual board.

399
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,210
But let's look at this one
because it's brighter.

400
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,280
If you're not familiar with
looking at chemical

401
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,350
structures, if you see these
dark areas in a molecule, it

402
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,150
means that the molecule is
coming out of the board

403
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,900
towards you.

404
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,750
So it gives a bit of

405
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,035
three-dimensionality to that molecule.

406
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,480
And here are the condensation
reactions involved in the

407
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,090
formation of maltose, which
is a glucose disaccharide.

408
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,800
And here is the glycosidic
linkage.

409
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,060
The atoms in carbohydrates
get particular numbers.

410
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,410
It is the carbon atoms that
get particular numbers.

411
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,270
And next lecture, that is going
to become very important

412
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,410
when we talk about
nucleic acids.

413
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,030
And here is sucrose, a dimer
of glucose and fructose.

414
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,610
Now, depending on the
orientation of these bonds

415
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,610
between the saccharides, between
the monomers, they may

416
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,620
or may not be able to be broken
by the enzymes, by the

417
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,030
chemicals in your body
that are involved

418
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,810
in hydrolysis reactions.

419
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,550
So sucroses can be broken down
pretty much by everyone.

420
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,350
But lactose, which is the
galactose-glucose dimer has

421
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,100
got a glycosidic bond which
has a particular shape.

422
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,150
And that particular shape is
only recognized by people who

423
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,890
have a molecule called
lactase--

424
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,160
we'll talk about this in
a couple of lectures--

425
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,820
which is able to break this
chemical bond here.

426
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,440
And if you're lactose
intolerant, the reason you get

427
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,400
stomach ache and so on is
because you get accumulation

428
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,260
of this disaccharide, and it
has side effects on your

429
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,475
digestive system.

430
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,600
All right.

431
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,930
So I want to tell you now about
a really fascinating

432
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:05,670
example of information as
encoded by carbohydrates.

433
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,780
We will have much more
to say about

434
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,860
carbohydrates as we go along.

435
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,510
But I'm going to tell you
about information--

436
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,510
particularly here, because
we won't talk about

437
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,600
it very much more.

438
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,150
One example of carbohydrates
giving information is in your

439
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,670
blood type.

440
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:28,130
So for blood type, there
are specific

441
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:36,580
carbohydrates for each.

442
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:50,270
But there is the same core set
of molecules, which is then

443
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:58,510
modified to give you the
different blood groups, to

444
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,780
four blood groups.

445
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,490
This is a representation of
the four blood groups.

446
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,610
They are called O,
A, B, and AB.

447
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,890
And you probably know
which one you are.

448
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,890
I am A.

449
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,850
One of those blood groups
is really valuable.

450
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,320
It's called O. And it's valuable
because anyone could

451
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,910
receive this blood
in a transfusion.

452
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:34,830
And anyone can because it's kind
of your basic blood type.

453
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,190
It contains an H group, which is
the basic sugar information

454
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,680
on blood cells.

455
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,800
And all of the other blood
groups also contains this

456
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,060
basic information, but they
contain other sugars as well,

457
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,890
here indicated by purple.

458
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,730
The key to these different
sugars is indicated below.

459
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:00,540
But O can be given to any kind
of person because you do not

460
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,520
have antibodies against this
particular H group.

461
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,090
Because everyone's got it.

462
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,440
So O is the only blood group
where, when you put it into

463
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,740
anyone, there are
not antibodies--

464
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,690
which you'll learn about
later in the course--

465
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,830
that will then attack the blood
cells and cause massive

466
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,300
blood clots and deaths.

467
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:32,540
When people donate blood, 3/4 of
it is not O. After a time,

468
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,690
blood is thrown away from blood
banks because it's not

469
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,540
usable forever.

470
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,430
And a lot of this type, A, B and
AB blood, is thrown away.

471
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,020
And so investigators have been
asking for a long time whether

472
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,270
they couldn't remove these extra
sugars from AB, B, and

473
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,190
A, and turn those bloods into
type O, which would then be

474
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,955
useful for everyone.

475
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:58,100
It turns out that's kind
of difficult to do.

476
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,080
But a few years ago, a group
did come up with

477
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,980
what may be a solution.

478
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,970
It still hasn't been proved,
even though this

479
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,810
was a few years ago.

480
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,430
It takes a long time.

481
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,889
Here's a different
representation of the sugars

482
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,389
on blood types.

483
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,710
Here's group A and group B.
And there are enzymes--

484
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,159
there you see, office hours.

485
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,770
I'm not kidding.

486
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,679
It's on my calendar.

487
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,340
All right.

488
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,699
There are substances, enzymes,
we'll talk about which can

489
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,080
actually remove some of these
sugars off groups A and B and

490
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,949
convert them into group O.
These substances, these

491
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,469
enzymes, were isolated
by Liu et al.

492
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,030
When you see this
at the bottom--

493
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,400
Here's a piece of education.

494
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,239
Often I will show you something,
and in the bottom

495
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,590
right-hand corner it will say
"Liu et al" or "Jones et al"

496
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,520
and a date.

497
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,800
That refers to a publication.

498
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,880
This group was able to convert
group type A and type B into a

499
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,900
type O. And they are now working
on a machine which can

500
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,600
convert type A, AB, and
B blood into type O.

501
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,850
And we'll stop there.
