8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,550
PROFESSOR: So here's
what we did.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,710
We found mutants that
effect biochemistry.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,330
That's one way to make the
connection between

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,830
function and gene.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,920
But if we want to go the other
way, we now have to do the

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,380
biochemistry of genetics.

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,960
What's biochemistry about?

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,210
It's purifying things
in a test tube.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,810
What's genetics about?

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,240
Heredity.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,630
So what do we have to do?

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,020
We have to purify heredity
in a test tube.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,600
But that's it.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,700
That's what we have to do.

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,730
If we're going to make that
connection in that direction,

23
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,990
all we need is to take a cell,
grind it up, and purify not

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,910
the enzyme that digests
a sugar, but heredity.

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,120
We need to get a pure
tube of heredity.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,674
You can imagine that this wasn't
an obvious thing to do,

27
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:07,460
how you get a pure
tube of heredity.

28
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,910
The problem is you
need an assay.

29
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,470
If you want to find an
enzyme that digests a

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,710
sugar, you have an acid.

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,560
You purify different fraction,
you make different fractions

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,450
of a cell you see which fraction
of the cell is able

33
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,100
to digest the sugar.

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,330
But if I make different
fractions of the cell, it's

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,250
not obvious how I figure out
which fraction of the cell has

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,780
heredity in it.

37
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,320
And yet, that's exactly
what was done, and

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,800
that's today's lecture.

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:37,725
So purifying heredity.

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,055
The discovery of the
transforming principle.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,390
By the transforming principle,
I don't mean an

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,250
idea, like a principle.

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,850
I mean a substance.

44
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,199
This is an old medieval kind
of word, a principle.

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,400
It's kind of a Harry Potteresque
kind of word or

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,800
something like that of what is
the transforming principle,

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
the transforming substance.

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,050
It's the kind of word alchemists
would like to use,

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,960
but it was actually what's
attached to this, and it was

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,610
called at the time the
transforming principle, the

51
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,240
transforming substance.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,660
And it really is the work in
1928 of a young scientist F.

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,970
Griffiths in London.

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,180
Griffiths was particularly
interested in studying the

55
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,680
bacteria pneumococcus.

56
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,030
Why was Griffith so interested
in studying the bacteria

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,500
pneumococcus?

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,220
Well, not so long before in
1918, there had been the

59
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,570
terrible Spanish influenza
epidemic that had killed

60
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,200
millions of people around the
world, the worst flu ever.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,660
Millions of people died by
this flew, and one of the

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,310
reasons they died when they
have the flu was they got

63
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,200
pneumococcal infections.

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,140
Griffiths was trying to make a
vaccine against pneumococcus,

65
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,870
a pretty good idea trying to
make a vaccine against

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,130
pneumococcus.

67
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,400
Pneumococcus highly virulent
stuff, but particularly if

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,220
you're compromised
by the influenza.

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,510
So what did he do?

70
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,640
Well, Griffiths had a strain
of pneumococcus.

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,550
He didn't, by the way, infect
people with it.

72
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,570
He infected mice with it, that
being considered a somewhat

73
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,980
more ethical way to
do the experiment.

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,610
So he had a strain of
pneumococcus that had a

75
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,900
smooth, glistening coat.

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,710
When you looked at it, it
was smooth and white and

77
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,430
glistened, the colonies
that it made

78
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,750
smooth, white, glistened.

79
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,780
And it was virulent.

80
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,350
If you inject it into a mouse,
the mouse got pneumococcus

81
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,970
infection, and it died.

82
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,180
It turns out we now know
that it has a beautiful

83
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,760
polysaccharide coat around it
that provides resistance to

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,780
the host's immune system,
et cetera.

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,610
He also had a strain
of pneumococcus

86
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,380
that had a rough coat.

87
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,660
It was not glistening.

88
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,110
It was kind of dull looking,
and it was non-virulent.

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,570
He injected it into a
mouse, mouse lives.

90
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,550
It happens to be the case that
we now know that it had a

91
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,190
mutation in a gene that produced
that coat, but that

92
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,060
doesn't much matter.

93
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,120
It didn't produce that
polysaccharide, and therefore,

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,880
was more easily fought off
by the immune system.

95
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,130
So Griffiths does the following
experiment.

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:47,750
He takes his smooth, virulent
bacteria, he injects it into a

97
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,070
mouse, that's a mouse.

98
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,300
And what happens to the mouse?

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,620
AUDIENCE: Dies.

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,870
PROFESSOR: Dies.

101
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,180
Exactly.

102
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,250
That's a dead mouse.

103
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,220
And one of the easier assays
in molecular biology is the

104
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,210
feet up, feet down assay.

105
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,380
All right.

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,910
Dead mouse.

107
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,120
Now, what does he do?

108
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,800
He takes the rough,
non-virulent, he injects it

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,335
into a mouse, and
what happens?

110
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,800
Lives.

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,460
Right?

112
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,710
Lives.

113
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,790
Then what he does, he takes the
smooth, virulent and he

114
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,860
bakes it in an autoclave.

115
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,845
He heat kills this bacteria.

116
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,260
Now, this heat-killed, dead,
virulent bacteria when

117
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,770
injected into a mouse, what
happens to the mouse?

118
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,650
It's alive.

119
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,130
The mouse is fine.

120
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,000
The bacteria was dead.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,300
And then he does the following
truly weird experiment.

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,440
He takes the absolutely
harmless, rough, non-virulent

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:19,800
bacteria but alive, plus the
smooth, virulent bacteria that

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,960
has been killed by heat,
heat-killed.

125
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,100
The rough stuff is harmless.

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,240
The smooth heat-killed
stuff, harmless.

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,440
Both are harmless.

128
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,690
We've shown the mouse can
live with this injected.

129
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,700
It can live with
this injected.

130
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,700
He injects it into the mouse,
and what happens?

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,950
Dead mouse.

132
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,350
Very surprising.

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,320
Not only that, when he takes the
blood of the dead mouse,

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,130
he can culture out of it.

135
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,370
He can culture on a Petri plate
from this dead mouse

136
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,760
live, smooth, virulent
bacteria.

137
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,970
How did that happen?

138
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,420
Somehow, we didn't have any
live, smooth bacteria.

139
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,575
We had dead, smooth bacteria.

140
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,750
We had live non-virulent
bacteria.

141
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,680
Somehow, the dead stuff
transformed the live harmless

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,120
stuff into virulence.

143
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,030
It transformed it.

144
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,030
The substance, the unknown
substance that transformed it

145
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,980
was referred to as the
transforming principle or

146
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,000
transforming stuff.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,840
And now we have biochemistry
because we have an assay.

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,660
We could take the dead, virulent
bacteria and break it

149
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,120
up into fractions and see
which substance, which

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,050
fraction, is it a protein?

151
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,880
Is it a carbohydrate?

152
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,840
Is it nucleic acid?

153
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,090
Is it something, is the
transforming substance and

154
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,960
purify heredity because we
have seen the transfer of

155
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,950
heredity to the harmless
bacteria.

156
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,590
There is an assay.

157
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,530
The minute there's an assay,
you could do biochemistry.

158
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,060
Now, the problem was the assay
was painfully slow.

159
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,370
You had to grind up the dead
bacteria, you had to

160
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,300
demonstrate by mixing it
together, putting it into a

161
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,240
mouse, waiting months, and then
you had to get a further

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,020
sub fraction.

163
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,000
It was just painfully slow.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,860
All this mouse stuff
and all that.

165
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,070
And Griffiths didn't make much
progress through the 1930s,

166
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,820
but he kept going at it.

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,360
And I suspect might have gotten
there except for the

168
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,850
fact that in 1941, his lab was
hit by a German bomb during a

169
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,360
blitz, and he died.

170
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,440
And so Griffiths never saw the
result of this, but he did

171
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,620
purify fractions and all that.

172
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,410
But thank goodness others
picked it up.

173
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,180
He was again, Griffiths
was a great guy.

174
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,250
He worked in World War I, worked
during World War II on

175
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,370
important public health
problems, and really lays this

176
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,660
foundation, but never really
purified what the final

177
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,240
substance was because he
died in a bombing.

178
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,060
But then you get in 1943, during
World War II, folks

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,930
working in New York City at
Rockefeller University, then

180
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:36,040
Rockefeller Institute, Avery,
McCarty, and MacLeod continue

181
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,620
this work, and they do
it without the mouse.

182
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,570
Because what they do is they
grind up the virulent stuff

183
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,180
and they sprinkle it on the
living stuff, the living

184
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,290
bacteria and played it out,
and just looked for the

185
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,370
appearance of colonies
that are transformed.

186
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,980
Skip the mouse.

187
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,790
Skipping the mouse makes it a
lot easier, because you can do

188
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,080
those experiments
pretty quickly.

189
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,570
Bacteria grow quickly.

190
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,090
Same basic idea.

191
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,830
Purify the stuff from the smooth
dead stuff, grind it

192
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,740
up, put it in different
fractions, apply them, and

193
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,900
then sprinkle them on a
plate, and look for

194
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,120
the occasional colony.

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,300
And now you're just going to
look for a fraction of the

196
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,970
material that has the capability
to produce some

197
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,460
smooth colonies.

198
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,270
Well, they did that, and they
purified it, and the purified

199
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,060
it, and they purified it, and
they purified it, and they

200
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,230
eventually found that the
particular type of molecule

201
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,280
that they purified appeared
to be DNA.

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:52,660
But when they purified fractions
containing DNA,

203
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,620
these fractions had the
ability to transform.

204
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,610
Wow.

205
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,100
You might immediately say,
that's the transforming

206
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,070
principle, DNA.

207
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,130
That's the transforming
substance.

208
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,380
What do you think the
reaction was?

209
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,220
Skepticism.

210
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,590
First, it should be
noted it's 1943.

211
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,210
People were busy at
the time, right?

212
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,040
We're in the middle
World War II.

213
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,280
It wasn't exactly top on
people's minds, but there was

214
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,430
enormous skepticism
scientifically of those people

215
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,420
who did follow the work.

216
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,950
Why?

217
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,020
Because the one thing they knew
was that DNA was truly a

218
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,770
boring molecule.

219
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,330
It was understood by all smart
people that DNA was an

220
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,200
incredibly boring structural
molecule that had none of the

221
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,840
fascinating diversity and
richness of proteins.

222
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,660
Proteins could do zillions
of different things.

223
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,730
DNA, you know, it's
just scaffolding.

224
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,930
Why?

225
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,090
What is the structure of DNA?

226
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,310
So let's turn to the structure
of DNA to see why it is that

227
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,570
people were not impressed.

228
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,210
Of course, when people are not
impressed, you purified

229
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,580
something and you show it
transforms, what do you say to

230
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,000
Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod?

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,610
How do you express
your skepticism?

232
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,360
You say, it's very good.

233
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,220
You've purified this and it
contains DNA, but is it

234
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,570
absolutely totally 100% pure or
is it possible that you've

235
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,550
carried along in the fraction
that you have purified some

236
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,610
other trace quantity of a highly
potent protein that is

237
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,290
really causing heredity?

238
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,200
And of course, that's the
problem is you can never prove

239
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,950
that there's not a teeny smidgen
of something in there.

240
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,280
You can only show how pure it
is, but you can never rule

241
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,060
something out.

242
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,490
So when people want to sort
of dis your biochemistry

243
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,480
experiments, it's always easy
to say, it was probably

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,290
something else in there too you
just don't know about it.

245
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,230
And that was what the
answer was to them.

246
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,300
But let's look at the
structure of DNA.

247
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,580
So DNA has three important
components

248
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,050
which we need to learn.

249
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,095
A, it has a sugar called
2 prime deoxyribose.

250
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,940
So ribose is a 5-carbon sugar.

251
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,590
A five-part carbon sugar
is a pentose.

252
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,770
So this is a sugar, in fact a
pentose, pentose of course

253
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,600
five, pentose meaning it's a
5-carbon sugar, but it lacks a

254
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,870
hydroxyl group.

255
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,490
So it's just slightly
different from

256
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,690
the 5-carbon sugar.

257
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,485
And we draw it in this
configuration where there is

258
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:52,620
the 1 prime carbon here, the 2
prime carbon here, the 3 prime

259
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,660
carbon here, the 4 prime carbon
here, the 5 prime

260
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,940
carbon here.

261
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,820
That's very important to know.

262
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,550
We've got an oxygen up here.

263
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:10,200
Here, we have an OH and an H.
Here, we have an H and an OH.

264
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:20,990
Here we have H. Here we
have our OH, H, H.

265
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,040
But here we should have
a hydroxyl off every

266
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,110
carbon, and we don't.

267
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,280
Only here are deoxy.

268
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,030
That's the only difference from
this being a perfectly

269
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,440
normal ribose, deoxy at
the 2 prime position.

270
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,390
Big deal.

271
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:51,260
Now, the next component of DNA
that you need to know about

272
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,890
are these nitrogenous bases.

273
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:08,730
So hanging off our
ribose is a base.

274
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,940
This base has carbons, oxygens,

275
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,920
hydrogens, and nitrogens.

276
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:42,830
And they come in four flavors,
adenine, A, guanine, G,

277
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:54,880
thymine, T, cytosine, C. A, T,
C and G, and we'll look at

278
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,700
their structure in
just a moment.

279
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,690
Then the next important part
if we look at this

280
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:18,450
conceptually, is that hanging
off here, we have a

281
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,700
triphosphate.

282
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,290
We have a triphosphate.

283
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,315
So this is the monomer for
making DNA, triphosphate.

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,110
We have a sugar, the sugar in
exactly the same place off the

285
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,900
1 prime carbon there has a base,
off the 5 prime carbon,

286
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,090
we have a triphosphate.

287
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,240
What's the triphosphate
good for?

288
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,859
Energy.

289
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,200
We're going to do a
polymerization, and that's

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,010
going to contribute the energy
for the polymerization, and

291
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,700
that's pretty much it.

292
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,089
That's the way to
think about DNA.

293
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,690
So when we do our polymerization
now, we

294
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:44,706
polymerize and we get base,
CH2, phosphate.

295
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,050
And then coming down this way
attached here, we have our

296
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:12,890
phosphate, and that attaches
to the 5 prime carbon here,

297
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,840
and onward that way.

298
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:28,170
So notice that our polymer goes
from a 5-prime carbon

299
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:35,710
here, 3-prime carbon here,
5-prime carbon here, 3-prime

300
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,390
carbon there.

301
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,530
And we go sugar, phosphate,
sugar, phosphate, sugar,

302
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,240
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,
5-prime attachment, 3-prime

303
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,430
attachment, 5-prime attachment,
3-prime

304
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,370
attachment.

305
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,680
That's DNA.

306
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,630
Pretty boring.

307
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,060
The same sugar, same phosphates
strung together,

308
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,850
totally boring.

309
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,270
The only difference
are these bases.

310
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,860
And there's only four of them,
and they're not very

311
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,582
impressive.

312
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:10,460
They're pretty boring,
these bases.

313
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,920
There are purines.

314
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,900
The A and G are purines,
and their ring

315
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,750
structure looks like this.

316
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,590
This is six-membered ring and
there's a five-membered ring.

317
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:31,870
There are pyrimidines, T and
C, and they just have a

318
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,120
six-membered ring.

319
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,890
They've got carbons, and
oxygens, and nitrogens, and

320
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,510
hydrogens, and they
don't differ

321
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,630
really in their charges.

322
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,670
By compared to the amino acids,
positive charges,

323
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,820
negative charges, hydrophobic
groups,

324
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,660
sulfurs that are reactive.

325
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,230
Amino acids, that's
impressive.

326
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,030
Those 20 different side chains
have wildly different chemical

327
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,820
properties.

328
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,510
These form measly bases, have
essentially, the same chemical

329
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,300
properties.

330
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,240
There's nothing very different
about their chemical

331
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,410
properties and therefore, all
smart right-thinking people

332
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,220
recognize the DNA
could not be a

333
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,800
particularly interesting molecule.

334
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,020
It had to be largely
a structural

335
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,850
molecule of some sort.

336
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,400
So when Avery, McCarty, and
MacLeod tell us ah, the

337
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,695
transforming principle of
DNA, nobody's impressed.

338
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,500
But of course, it's
World War II.

339
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,020
People are busy.

340
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,670
Lot of things going on.

341
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,810
And not that long afterwards,
not that long afterwards,

342
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,400
another really important
experiment gets done in the

343
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:56,515
early 1950s, the Hershey-Chase
experiment.

344
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,260
Hershey is not the candy bar.

345
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,500
It is Alfred Hershey
and Martha Chase.

346
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,680
Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey
do a cool experiment.

347
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,780
People were studying something
else at the time.

348
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:26,060
They were studying the viruses
that infect bacteria,

349
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,470
bacterial viruses.

350
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,670
So it turns out just like you
may get a viral infection, E.

351
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,540
coli gets viral infections
too.

352
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,440
It usually dies of them or at
least often dies of viral

353
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,830
infection, not necessarily
usually, I take that back,

354
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,300
sometimes dies of viral
infections.

355
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,120
So that is a virus, actually,
greatly magnified, glommed on

356
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,710
to E. coli, virus E. coli.

357
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:06,560
What happens is, if you mix
the virus with E. coli, it

358
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,850
gloms on, and then if you wait
a little while giving it a

359
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,880
happy medium to grow in, the E.
coli some time later, half

360
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,760
an hour later maybe, bursts
open, dead, and spews out

361
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,140
zillions of viral particles
which could go on

362
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,080
to infect new cells.

363
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,180
How does it do that?

364
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,470
How does it instruct E. coli
to make viral particles?

365
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,070
It must be bringing
information.

366
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,080
It's having progeny.

367
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,100
It is passing on heredity too.

368
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,940
It has some transforming
information.

369
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,310
Where is the transforming
principle in the little virus?

370
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,560
It gloms on to the cell somehow
gives something into

371
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,210
the cell, and poof, 20 minutes
later, half an hour later,

372
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,060
lots of viruses.

373
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,360
Where's the information
carried?

374
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,030
Now, this was a much
simpler system.

375
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,780
This system, you're asking
what's in the bacterial virus.

376
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,170
There's not a lot in
a bacterial virus.

377
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,750
It's not like a cell that
have zillions of things.

378
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,110
The bacterial virus is a
pretty simple particle.

379
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:32,890
The bacteria virus consists of
protein coat, proteins are on

380
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,305
the outside, DNA
on the inside.

381
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,490
That's it.

382
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,070
You don't have a lot to work
with, a limited number of

383
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,390
proteins, DNA in the middle.

384
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,890
These things just as an aside
were thought to kind of like

385
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,030
eat bacteria.

386
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,040
Because they were thought to
eat bacteria in a way by at

387
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,470
least the early things, they're
called bacteriophage,

388
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,720
bacteriophage.

389
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,390
The word phage means to eat.

390
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,690
So you may hear me talking about
bacteriophage, meaning

391
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,520
eaters of bacteria.

392
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,620
Indeed, actually there was some
nutty ideas in the 1920s

393
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,860
and 1930s when bacteriophage
were first discovered that the

394
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,710
way to cure a bacterial
infection was to drink a lot

395
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,960
of bacteriophage.

396
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,660
They would kill the bacteria.

397
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,190
It's a thought.

398
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,570
People actually tried
these things.

399
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,830
Anyway, it turns out not
to be such a good idea.

400
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,970
So Hershey and Chase decided
we're going to figure out

401
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,690
which is it?

402
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,650
Is it the DNA or is
it the protein?

403
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,560
How do you find out?

404
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:50,820
Yeah?

405
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

406
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,480
PROFESSOR: Put in only protein,
and see what happens.

407
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,930
So take the bacteriophage,
purify it from

408
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,500
protein verses DNA.

409
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,730
I've got a pure component of the
protein, I sprinkle it on,

410
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,800
nothing happens.

411
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,080
I take the DNA, I sprinkle
it on, nothing happens.

412
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,920
Neither works.

413
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,170
Why is that?

414
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

415
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,370
PROFESSOR: The shape, those
little feet in the shape were

416
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,060
critical for the
pathogenicity.

417
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,840
So when we grind up the virus,
it doesn't work anymore.

418
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,800
It's a great idea.

419
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,740
If it worked, bingo, we'd have
it, and that should be the

420
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,400
first experiment we do
because it's so easy.

421
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,430
But it turned out not to work.

422
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,830
Yes?

423
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

424
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:50,680
PROFESSOR: Put a chemical marker
on the protein, put a

425
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,490
chemical marker on the DNA,
and see which one

426
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,000
goes into the cell.

427
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,250
What chemical marker?

428
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,370
How are we going to attach a
chemical marker to the protein

429
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,330
without messing it up?

430
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,580
We can't mess up the
protein, right?

431
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,660
It still got to function.

432
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,520
How do we get a chemical
marker on it?

433
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

434
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:12,845
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

435
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

436
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,150
PROFESSOR: So what chemical
do you want me to put in?

437
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,910
Well, how am I going to tell
whether, DNA's got phosphorus.

438
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,654
How am I going to follow
the phosphorus?

439
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,030
AUDIENCE: Radioactive tag.

440
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,330
PROFESSOR: Radioactive tag.

441
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,250
Bingo.

442
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,650
What if I used radioactive
tags, and I made a

443
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,980
radioactively-labeled virus.

444
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,720
How can I radioactively
label the DNA?

445
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

446
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,850
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

447
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,586
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

448
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,260
PROFESSOR: A radioactive base.

449
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,330
I could do that.

450
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,960
What else could I do?

451
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,360
Yup?

452
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,080
AUDIENCE: Phosphorus.

453
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,930
PROFESSOR: Phosphorus.

454
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,470
Phosphorus has the nice property
that phosphorus is in

455
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,750
my DNA, but it's not
an proteins.

456
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,630
So what do I use?

457
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,110
Phosphorus-32, P-32.

458
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,820
So I use P-32, and how do I
manage to chemically create a

459
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,040
virus that has P-32 in it?

460
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

461
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,060
PROFESSOR: Just throw it in the
solution with P-32, and

462
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,410
the virus will take care
that itself, right?

463
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,610
So simply grow virus for a while
in the presence of P-32.

464
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,730
Let's do that.

465
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,290
So grow virus in a test
tube with bacteria.

466
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,740
Here's my bacteria.

467
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,220
Here's my virus I've put in
there, and let me put in P-32,

468
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,640
and what I'll get is
P-32-labeled labeled virus.

469
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,890
How do I label my protein?

470
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,880
Someone said it already.

471
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,650
What elements can we
find that's in

472
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,462
proteins but not in DNA?

473
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,938
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

474
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:55,705
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

475
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:56,385
AUDIENCE: Sulfur.

476
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,870
PROFESSOR: Sulfur.

477
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,380
Sulfur.

478
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,370
S-35 is a radioactive isotope of
sulfur, and if I grow it, I

479
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,870
can S-35 label the proteins
in my virus.

480
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,920
Nice.

481
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,420
This radioactive labeling
trick is very cool.

482
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,340
So I take it, I take some
P-32-labeled virus where these

483
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,910
P-32 was only in the DNA.

484
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,110
I got some S-35-labeled
label virus where the

485
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,890
S-35 is in the protein.

486
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:38,160
I could mix them together, now
do my experiment, wait 20

487
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,220
minutes and, or even wait last
10, 15 minutes, and see which

488
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,070
element has gone
into the cell.

489
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,320
How do I do that?

490
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,620
See I've got my cells here,
and I've got the viruses

491
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,350
attached to them, and they've
injected something in here.

492
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,010
They've either injected
a protein or

493
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,560
they've injected DNA.

494
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,940
What was injected?

495
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,290
I need to carefully go in there
and remove the virus and

496
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,640
look at just what's
in the cell.

497
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,880
I have to now separate the virus
glommed onto the outside

498
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,580
of the cell from the cell.

499
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,070
So do I use micro manipulator
tweezers to

500
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,522
pull off the virus?

501
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

502
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,930
PROFESSOR: Well, if I
denature, I might

503
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,600
crack open the cell.

504
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,110
Centrifuge it.

505
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,080
If I centrifuge it, the whole
thing will spin down.

506
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,040
I need to kind of knock the
viruses off the cell,

507
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,550
physically.

508
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,520
I just got to agitate it so
I get them off the cell.

509
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,450
With enough kind of hydrodynamic
agitation, the

510
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,980
viruses fall off.

511
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,310
So a device was created that
was able to just perfectly

512
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,140
knock the viruses off.

513
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,240
It's referred to as the Waring
kitchen blender.

514
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,620
It turns on your kitchen blender
is perfect for this.

515
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,780
Take the viruses, add it to the
bacteria, sit for a little

516
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,470
bit, put it in your kitchen
blender, press puree.

517
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,240
And let's say on puree setting,
the viruses fall off,

518
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,770
and now you can spin it in a
centrifuge, the bacteria are

519
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,370
denser, they come down.

520
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,600
The viruses are lighter, they
stay in the supernatant, and

521
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,760
you can take the supernatant and
the pellet at the bottom

522
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,920
over your radioactivity counter
and see which one is

523
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,220
in the bacteria.

524
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,600
These were referred to as the
famous Waring blender

525
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,330
experiments.

526
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,310
They really are, actually.

527
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,320
So you put this in the Waring
blender, you knock off the

528
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:54,710
viruses, you spin it down, and
what happens is after you've

529
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,150
done it, there's a pellet here
of the bacteria that are spun

530
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,200
down in the centrifuge.

531
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,440
The virus particles
are still up here.

532
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,880
We take this pellet over to our
counter, and which element

533
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,165
do we find in great abundance,
S-35 or P-32?

534
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:12,975
AUDIENCE: P-32.

535
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:17,740
PROFESSOR: P-32.

536
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,940
The DNA is what's going in.

537
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,500
Bingo.

538
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,510
Nice experiment.

539
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,190
Now if you were churlish,
couldn't you say, yeah, look

540
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,600
it's mostly the DNA, but there's
a little smidgen of

541
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,480
protein maybe, that
came along too.

542
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,770
Do you think they found
absolutely zero S-35 in there?

543
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,910
No, because they don't perfectly
knock the virus off.

544
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,160
Some of it kind of sticks.

545
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,180
There's 1% S-35.

546
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,770
And if you're being really
churlish about this you would

547
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,490
say I still don't believe you.

548
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,400
But now you have it from two
different directions.

549
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,600
You have it from the
pneumococcus, this bacteria

550
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,940
experiment from Avery, McCarty,
and MacLeod Hershey

551
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,930
and Chase coming from two
different systems.

552
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,710
They're giving you
the same answer.

553
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,620
It's pretty clear.

554
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,250
It's in the air.

555
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,810
People know DNA is the stuff.

556
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,280
They're believing it now.

557
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,580
DNA is the stuff.

558
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,460
But how does it work?

559
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,840
How can this dumb molecule
possibly be the

560
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,050
transforming principle?

561
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,130
Well, smart, young people
want to know.

562
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:29,200
So an erstwhile ornithologist,
that is a college kid from the

563
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,220
University of Indiana who
particularly liked bird

564
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,490
watching got very enamored by
this problem, actually based

565
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,390
on some fabulous faculty at
the University of Indiana.

566
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,150
He got really intrigued by how
could DNA possibly do this.

567
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,600
But he recognized he didn't
know any chemistry.

568
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,010
He decided to go to Cambridge,
England to the Medical

569
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,440
Research Council lab, the MRC
lab in Cambridge, England

570
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,190
where he teamed up with someone
who did a lot of

571
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,350
talking and very few
experiments.

572
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,820
A physicist who had worked for
the British admiralty during

573
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,330
World War II on classified
things and had somehow gotten

574
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,440
interested in biology.

575
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,110
And because he had this kid,
this recently graduated

576
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,310
college kid, and you had this
35-year-old physicist who

577
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,840
nobody was quite sure what to
make of, they kind of hung out

578
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
with each other in
the same office.

579
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,960
And they didn't really do many
experiments, but boy did they

580
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,400
do a lot of talking, and
thinking, and looking at all

581
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,870
the data that were out there.

582
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,510
And that's pretty much what
James Watson and Francis Crick

583
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,610
were doing.

584
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,430
They knew this problem
was important.

585
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,330
And Jim and Francis would talk
every day about this stuff,

586
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,050
and they will talk to people
down the hall who really knew

587
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,290
about the chemistry
of nucleic acids.

588
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:55,230
And they went down to London to
Maurice Wilkins' lab where

589
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,660
crystals were being
made of DNA.

590
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,810
And Rosalind Franklin, who was
a fantastic scientist and had

591
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,930
managed to make crystals of DNA,
showed Crick and Watson

592
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,460
her crystals of DNA.

593
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,670
Francis Crick being a physicist
was very good at

594
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,500
understanding crystallography
and how crystal structures and

595
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,949
x-ray diffraction patterns
related to each other.

596
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,550
And Francis knew immediately
this thing had to be a helix.

597
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,839
He could tell it was a helix.

598
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,969
And they went back, and based
on Rosalind Franklin's x-ray

599
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:35,300
diffraction patterns, went and
made a model, a model for the

600
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,360
structure of DNA.

601
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,330
You all know the model.

602
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,389
You've seen the double
helix forever.

603
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:45,290
It's a cultural icon, but that's
how this came about.

604
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:57,530
And The Double Helix, the
Structure of DNA, April of

605
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,330
1953 is published.

606
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:13,090
The double helix has two
strands running an

607
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:19,730
anti-parallel directions, 5
prime to 3 prime, 5 prime to 3

608
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,950
prime anti-parallel directions,
and it has a

609
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:32,240
perfect base pairing between
purines and pyrimidines.

610
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,350
If you have a T, and
I'm just going to

611
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,050
draw this very quickly.

612
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,620
You can look in your book for
getting it just right.

613
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,990
You have two hydrogen bonds.

614
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:11,590
That's T and A, and if you
have a C, you have three

615
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:25,075
hydrogen bonds that perfectly
hold it to the G, et cetera.

616
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,520
So notice C and G fit perfectly
together to make

617
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,140
three hydrogen bonds.

618
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,620
A and T fit perfectly together
to make two hydrogen bonds,

619
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,500
and that was the key was to
recognize that when you stick

620
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,140
them together in that way, you
get exactly the same width.

621
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,510
They fit perfectly.

622
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,900
You couldn't match an A with a
G, an A with a C, you could

623
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,700
only match the A with
a T. That was it.

624
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,190
Brilliant.

625
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,640
Beautiful.

626
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,200
Now, you guys should read
Crick's book The Double Helix

627
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,610
in which he tells the stories
because it's just a

628
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,770
fascinating, fascinating
business.

629
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,900
He'll tell, or others will
tell actually, the story.

630
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,770
So you know what this
means by the way?

631
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,350
This means that the amount of
A should equal the amount of

632
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,470
T. And the amount of G should
equal the amount of C.

633
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,575
There should be a ratio, a
one-to-one ratio that the A to

634
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:23,230
T ratio should be one to one.

635
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,520
And the G to C ratio should
be one to one.

636
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,340
Although any organism might have
more As than Ts and Gs

637
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,420
than Cs, the ratio of these guys
should be one and these

638
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,020
guys should be one.

639
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,700
This actually was discovered
by a chemist at Columbia

640
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,950
called Chargaff.

641
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,380
These were called Chargaff's
rules.

642
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,250
Chargaff was a very
distinguished chemist who came

643
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,036
up with Chargaff's rules with
the As equals the Ts, and the

644
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:51,720
Gs equals the Cs, and
he didn't know

645
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,760
what to make of it.

646
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
By the way, Chargaff actually
visited Cambridge, England

647
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,700
while Crick and Watson were
there before their discovery,

648
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,630
and he had lunch with them.

649
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,920
And he related that Crick and
Watson seemed like Bozos to

650
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,660
him, because they couldn't even
keep straight the exact

651
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,610
structure of the four bases.

652
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,860
They always had to keep
looking it up.

653
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,180
They hadn't memorized the
structures the four bases, and

654
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,580
Chargaff was such a brilliant
chemist, he, of course, knew

655
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,270
this instantly, et cetera,
et cetera.

656
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,680
And he said, these guys are
never going to get anywhere

657
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,705
because they really don't even
understand the structure of

658
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:29,090
the bases, haven't
memorized it.

659
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,020
When Crick and Watson's
discovery turned out to be the

660
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,940
single most important biological
discovery of the

661
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,770
20th century, Erwin Chargaff who
lived a very long life was

662
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,340
sort of bitter because he's kind
of worked it out in a way

663
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,680
with the ratio and never figured
out what it meant.

664
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,835
And he said one of the
bitterest, cuttingest comments

665
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:51,220
I've have ever heard from a
scientist which is referring

666
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,850
to Crick and Watson as still not
being impressed even after

667
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,120
they won their Nobel
Prize for this.

668
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,940
He said that two such pygmies
should cast such giant shadows

669
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,560
only shows how late
in the day it is.

670
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,810
Anyway, he was not happy to
have missed this point.

671
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,840
Crick and Watson were
very happy to have

672
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,180
figured this out.

673
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,330
They, when they figured this out
in February of 1953, what

674
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,710
do you do in England when you
make a big discovery?

675
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,596
AUDIENCE: You have tea.

676
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:23,284
PROFESSOR: No, you
don't have tea.

677
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:25,140
You go to the pub.

678
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,560
They went to the pub.

679
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,480
They ran down to the Eagle Pub,
they brought everybody

680
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,780
drinks, and they told everybody
at the Eagle Pub,

681
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,750
we've discovered the
secret of life.

682
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,590
The people at the Eagle Pub
had no idea what they were

683
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,980
talking about, but were happy to
have a round of drinks, and

684
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,190
there you go.

685
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,660
They immediately raced to
write this up in Nature.

686
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,290
It appears in Nature in
April of 1953, and

687
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,670
it's a one-page paper.

688
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,360
And get it on the
web and read it.

689
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,490
It's the single best one page
that has been written in

690
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,130
biology in the 20th century.

691
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,515
And of course, what
did they say?

692
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,590
The title is kind of unassuming,
"A Structure for

693
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,360
the Salt of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid," nothing too exciting.

694
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,460
But Crick and Watson
realized something.

695
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,290
What do they realize?

696
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:18,440
Crick and Watson realized
why is this a big deal?

697
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,320
Why is this double helix
so important?

698
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:38,850
Well, the implication of the
double helix is that if I have

699
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:47,680
a double helix and those strands
were to separate, each

700
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:56,930
would be a template for a
double helix, heredity.

701
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,660
How do you pass information
to two daughter cells?

702
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,700
You got a double helix.

703
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,200
It's redundant.

704
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,830
If you know the A is on
one strand, you know

705
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,230
the Ts on the other.

706
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,710
Unzip it, copy, voila.

707
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,020
I now have two copies
of heredity.

708
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,270
What's a mutation?

709
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,310
Occasionally get it wrong.

710
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:21,910
Bingo.

711
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,770
They saw it.

712
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,020
They knew.

713
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,390
Now, they didn't have
time to prove this.

714
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,960
I mean, who has time
to prove this.

715
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,940
This is such an exciting
discovery secret of life.

716
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,580
Drinks for everybody, they write
it up, but in the last

717
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,520
paragraph, they certainly don't
want anybody to think

718
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,110
that they missed the point.

719
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,160
And they write the coyest
sentence in molecular biology.

720
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,250
They write, "It has not escaped
our notice that this

721
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,480
structure offers an
explanation for

722
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,580
heredity and mutation.

723
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,870
We'll address this in another
paper." Cute.

724
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,130
Very cute.

725
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,290
They put down their marker, they
knew what it meant, but

726
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,720
they got the thing off to
Nature very quickly.

727
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,680
It was a hot topic.

728
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,950
They were competing
with other people.

729
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,030
You'll read about the
competition with Linus Pauling

730
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,550
and other things like that.

731
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,030
It had not escaped their notice
that this pretty much

732
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,410
explains heredity.

733
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,860
Now, of course, are
you convinced

734
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,330
that it explains heredity?

735
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,480
It's a nice model, but don't
we require proof?

736
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,520
We do require proof.

737
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,800
It's an ex post facto model, we
need proof, It's a pretty

738
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,230
good ex post facto model,
but we need proof.

739
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:39,650
So the last step, which I'll
touch on very briefly, was

740
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:46,530
proof of what's called
semi-conservative replication.

741
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,720
Meaning that each strand
is used for the other.

742
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,210
And I might run two
minutes over.

743
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:58,640
We'll see.

744
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,310
I'll try to keep
it within time.

745
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,290
Out at Caltech, two graduate
students, Frank Stahl and Matt

746
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,020
Meselson hear of this.

747
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,890
Matt Meselson by the
way is still

748
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,370
working in Harvard Square.

749
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,120
He's at Harvard.

750
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,520
He's a wonderful guy.

751
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,130
Matt is there.

752
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,410
You could ask Matt about this,
young graduate student at

753
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,590
Caltech in the early '50s.

754
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,660
Obviously, this model looks
like it must be right.

755
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,170
How do you prove it?

756
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:33,830
Well, Matt and Frank, Meselson
and Stahl came up with a cool

757
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,690
experiment to prove it.

758
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:46,940
Meselson and Stahl, they take
bacteria, here's my DNA in

759
00:43:46,940 --> 00:44:01,320
there, they want to show that
each strand, each, when we

760
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,170
make a new generation of
bacteria, the new DNA has one

761
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,270
old strand and one new strand.

762
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,400
That each old strand
is being used as a

763
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
template for a new strand.

764
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,240
How are we going to tell?

765
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,680
We gotta label it somehow.

766
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,875
We got a label the old strand
different than the new strand.

767
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,880
How do we possibly label and
they're the same chemical

768
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,930
composition?

769
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,115
What are we going to do?

770
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:28,985
AUDIENCE: Radioactivity.

771
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:33,600
PROFESSOR: Radioactivity or
some kind of isotope.

772
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,950
Well, they used an isotope.

773
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,660
What they did, super cool, they
grew this up, but not in

774
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,540
normal nitrogen, but in N-15,
not, by the way, radioactive,

775
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,780
but different weight.

776
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,560
They grew it up in N-15.

777
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,000
They added bacterias that had
grown up, and all of their DNA

778
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,240
had lots of N-15 in it
on both strands.

779
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,760
They then pour in a lot of
medium that has N-14.

780
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,650
Tons, they swamp it with
N-14 so what's this

781
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,610
strand going to be?

782
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,520
N-14.

783
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,660
So what can you tell me about
the difference between this

784
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,692
DNA and that DNA?

785
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:21,420
AUDIENCE: One's going
to be lighter.

786
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,430
PROFESSOR: One is going
to be lighter.

787
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,800
How do you measure how
much lighter it is?

788
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,920
They came up, they invented the
technique for this purpose

789
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,920
of centrifuging in
a salt gradient.

790
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,860
They put in the right amounts of
salt, cesium salt, and they

791
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,120
centrifuge it so hard that
there's a gradient of

792
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,730
densities, denser here,
lighter here.

793
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:54,570
And they find that this DNA
and this DNA centrifuge to

794
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,900
different places.

795
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,300
There's a difference
in their density.

796
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,300
The new DNA is half old,
N-15, half new, N-14.

797
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,810
It has the intermediate
density.

798
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,060
If I grow another generation,
I'm going to see some N-15

799
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,240
14s, and I'm also going
to see some N-14, 14s.

800
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,050
And that's what they found.

801
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,110
They invented this technique
it's isopycnic centrifugation

802
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:27,790
and Matt Meselson and Frank
Stahl provided an experimental

803
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,940
prediction of the beautiful
Crick-Watson model that was

804
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,170
fair to say the secret
of life.

805
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,200
Anyway, these are
the foundations.

806
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,560
Notice now, we've taken genetics
and used it to do

807
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,840
biochemistry.

808
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,500
We've taken biochemistry
and used it

809
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,230
to understand genetics.

810
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,590
And so finally, we are
making the bridge

811
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,580
of molecular biology.

812
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,830
Next time.
