WEBVTT

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.290
PROFESSOR: So, first step,
we need to cut our DNA.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:26.446
Step one, cut, which is going to
be DNA restriction enzymes.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.910
It turns out, quite remarkably,
that if I have a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:54.640
sequence of DNA, five prime A G
C T A G A A T T C T T A C C

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.000
three prime, and we'll
come backwards

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.250
filling in the sequence.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.170
It turns out that molecular
biologists are so cool that

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.100
they invented a protein that is
able to recognize that six

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.900
letter sequence, G-A-A-T-T-C.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.360
And it is able-- actually it's
G-A-A-T-T-C on this strand,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.190
but what is it coming back?

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.170
It's G-A-A-T-T-C. It's
the same thing.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.300
So actually this is
a palindrome.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.970
That's kind of nice.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.990
It's a palindrome--

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.220
it's a reverse palindrome.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.530
It's the same word spelled
backwards on the other strand.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.530
So what it does is it
cuts it like that.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.340
And what it produces is a DNA
molecule like this and a DNA

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.889
molecule like that, that's
mostly double stranded, but

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.500
has a four base pair overhang.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.640
The overhang reads
T-T-A-A here.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.610
It reads A-A-T-T there.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.760
And remember this is five prime
to three prime, five

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.720
prime to three prime.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.910
And there you go.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.030
This guy has its little
phosphate at the end there.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.156
This guy has his little
hydroxyl over there.

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:36.406
And it cuts it.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.340
Now that is an incredible
piece of engineering.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.260
To come up with a protein, to
devise a protein, that is able

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.850
to recognize those six bases
and cut at those six bases.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.970
And cut in just this
way making a really

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.350
clean overhang here.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.850
It's this cool five
prime overhang.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.080
Who do you think invented
this cool protein?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.600
What engineer came up with
this cool protein?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.320
AUDIENCE: MIT engineers.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.600
PROFESSOR: MIT engineers,
yeah.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.270
Not a chance.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.960
Not a chance.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.010
This is a really tough feat.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.610
This is something that can only
be done by the smartest

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.940
engineers on the planet.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.550
And MIT engineers are
unfortunately only the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.925
smartest human engineers
on the planet.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.196
Who came up with this
is E. coli.

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.940
AUDIENCE: So you found it
somewhere in nature?

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.490
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.020
AUDIENCE: You found it
somewhere in nature?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.950
PROFESSOR: Of course you find
it somewhere in nature.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.860
Almost everything important
that we say molecular

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
biologists have come up with, it
means molecular sat at the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.120
feet of the true masters,
bacteria, and learned from the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.310
true masters.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.080
This protein is found
in nature.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.330
And it's found in E. coli.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.090
In fact, it's found in E. coli
strain R. And it was the first

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.600
such protein found in E.
coli strain R, so it

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.290
gets the name EcoR1.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
And it cuts the DNA like this.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.140
Pretty cool.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.060
Pretty cool.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:33.820
Now, it turns out that E.
coli has this EcoR1.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.860
How often does E. coli--

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.875
so whenever I take EcoR1, this
protein, purified from E.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:43.520
coli, and I add it to DNA it
always cuts at this site,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.970
which we call an EcoR1 site.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.760
How frequently do we
expect, what's the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120
frequency of EcoR1 sites?

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.430
G-A-A-T-T-C, how often will
that occur at random?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.243
One in--

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.030
AUDIENCE: Two to the sixth?

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.520
PROFESSOR: One in two
to the sixth?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.280
How many letters do I have?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.790
AUDIENCE: Four, oh,
four to the sixth.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.090
PROFESSOR: One in four
to the sixth.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.850
My frequency should be about
one in four to the sixth,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.380
which is about what?

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.180
What's four to the sixth?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.100
It's two to the 12th.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.981
It's about 4,000.

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:21.830
It's about one in
4,000 letters.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.028
One in 4,000 bases.

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:26.070
So it's very convenient.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.780
One in every 4,000 bases
it'll roughly cut.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.000
It'll cut at roughly
one 4,000 bases.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.290
Why doesn't E. coli
cut its own DNA?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.020
If it's got this protein
floating around in its cell,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.610
why isn't it chopping
up its own DNA?

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.370
Doesn't have G-A-A-T-T-C?

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.480
Yeah, the problem is
it's so frequent.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.860
That'd be really hard
to make sure--

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.680
I mean, E. coli has 4 million
letters in its genome.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.500
This should cut every
4,000 bases.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.430
You expect about 1,000
such sequences.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.450
It might be hard to arrange
not to cut--

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.600
not to have any such
sequences.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.125
It's a good idea, is not to have
any, but an alternative--

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:12.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.940
PROFESSOR: It protects them.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.830
It turns out E. coli, instead
of avoiding the sequence

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.690
altogether, has another
trick up its sleeve.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.330
E. coli protects this sequence
whenever it occurs.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.215
So it turns out that whenever
you have a stretch of the E.

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:38.325
coli genome that has this
G-A-A-T-T-C in it, what E.

00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:41.020
coli does is it puts--

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.800
I'm just writing M-E here
for a methyl group.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.400
Right, C-H three up there.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.590
It puts a methyl group--

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.010
I'll write C-H three.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.510
There we go.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.620
It puts a methyl group on
the A, that middle A.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.900
Well, that is a cute trick that
E. coli uses, putting a

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.150
methyl group there.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.630
Because what happens is, when
there's a methyl group, right

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.930
at that position, the enzyme
no longer recognizes and no

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.180
longer cuts there.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.770
So that's kind of clever.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.555
E. coli makes this protein
that can recognize

00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:25.660
G-A-A-T-T-C, but it has a
second protein that puts

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.200
methyl groups there.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.830
And this protein happens
by accident

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.540
to be called a methylase.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.030
It has a methylase.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.930
And the methylase protects
that sequence.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.180
So now, this is really cool
engineering, but kind of dumb.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.230
What's it doing there?

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.230
It has something that cuts the
sequence and it protects the

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.550
sequence, why bother
having this?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.392
Yeah?

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:57.232
AUDIENCE: You can use it to cut
it at places to unwrap the

00:07:57.232 --> 00:07:58.200
true strands.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.410
PROFESSOR: That's an
interesting idea.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.140
We could use it to cut our DNA
and open it up to unravel our

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.010
true strands.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.820
It's a thought.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.710
Yes?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.150
AUDIENCE: To protect the
bacteria from viruses?

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.030
PROFESSOR: Protect the bacteria
from viruses.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.485
How do you protect yourself
from viruses?

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.540
Well, you have an immune system
with immune cells and

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.570
antibodies and all that.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.930
Does E. coli have an
immune system?

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.215
Why doesn't it have
immune cells?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.010
Because it's like one cell.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.710
How's it going to have an
immune system, right?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.320
So suppose E. coli
gets a cold.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.700
Suppose it gets infected
by a virus.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.610
How's it going to
protect itself?

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.830
Cut at a frequently occurring
DNA sequence.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.720
Now the virus, of course, isn't
methylated there, bingo.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.100
That's how it tells its own--

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.080
you can tell cell
from an invader.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.520
E. coli can tell cell from
an invader because it's

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.590
methylated its own G-A-A-T-T-C
sites, but the virus isn't

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.130
methylated there.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.980
Way cool.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.880
This is an immune system
for E. coli.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.440
Now, it turns out-- so
this is protection.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:21.460
These restriction enzymes
protect E. coli from viruses.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.750
It turns out that E.
coli is not alone

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.580
in this clever trick.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.770
It turns out that other bacteria
have also thought of

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.270
this trick.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.870
So it turns out that there is
another restriction enzyme

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:54.040
that cuts at G-G-A-T-C-C. And
on the other strand it goes

00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:01.750
G-G-A-T-C-C. It, again, cuts in
that distinctive pattern.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.005
And it's called BamH1.

00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.650
And there's another guy.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:20.060
And he cuts at A-A-G-C-T-T,
A-A-G-C-T-T. And it

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.040
also cuts like that.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.820
And it's called HindIII.

00:10:28.004 --> 00:10:32.960
And there's some that
cut at G-A-T-C, just

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.390
the four letter word.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.170
And they cut like that.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:54.790
And there's some that cut at
C-A-G-C-T-G, C-A-G-C-T-G, and

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.380
this, cuts smack
in the middle.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.690
In other words, there's a wide
number of different tricks.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.370
Some cut at six bases.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.740
Some cut at four bases.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.590
Some cut at eight bases.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.710
Some cut leaving an overhang.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.640
Some cut smack in the middle.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.670
Some cut leaving the overhang
in the other direction.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.240
Some allow a degenerate
base in the middle.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.350
It doesn't care which base
is in the middle.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.110
There's a zillion different
solutions that bacteria have

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.390
come up with for their
immune system.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.390
And so, if I want to cut up some
human DNA all I need is

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.420
say, this protein EcoR1 or BamH1
or HindIII or MVL 1 or

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.695
PVU 2 or et cetera.

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:40.710
And I can do that by growing
up E. coli and

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.960
purifying the protein.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.010
And if I wanted HindIII, I
would grow up haemophilus

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.060
influenza and purify
the protein.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.890
So in a molecular biology lab,
today, if you want to cut up

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.000
human DNA, you could grow up
some E. coli and purify EcoR1

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.250
or haemophilus influenza.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.710
And that is indeed what ancient
molecular biologists

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:09.360
did in prehistoric days in
the 1970s and 1980s.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.000
They would purify their own
restriction enzymes.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.090
They're still alive today.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.400
You can talk to them.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.140
There are many of them
on the faculty.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.010
And they'll tell you how it put
hair on their chest to be

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.265
able to purify their own
restriction enzymes.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.150
What do you do today?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.275
Order it online from
the catalog, right?

00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:36.065
You know, there's the
catalog, the New

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:38.480
England Bio Labs catalog.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.730
Let's see what we got here.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:53.470
Restriction enzymes, modifying
enzymes, polymerases, all

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:59.150
right, EcoR1, sale on
EcoR1 right now.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.070
$100 buys you 10,000
units of EcoR1.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.030
It's in the catalog.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.780
You can go online.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.270
You can order it.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.390
You can have it tomorrow
by FedEx.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.480
So, but that's how it works.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.810
It's in the catalog.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.930
So you can get any restriction
enzyme you want to cut DNA

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.180
anywhere you want to.
