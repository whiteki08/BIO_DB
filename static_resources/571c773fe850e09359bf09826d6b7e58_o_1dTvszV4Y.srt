1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,750
ERIC LANDER: Good morning.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,000
Good morning.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:27,330
So last time, we ran
into a problem.

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,760
We had Mendel, my hero Mendel,
this MIT-like mathematical,

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,200
physical monk, had developed
this gorgeous theory of

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,500
particles of inheritance.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,330
He didn't use the
word "gene" yet.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,295
Gene doesn't get invented
for much longer.

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,760
For every trait, you had
two such particles.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:53,922
You gave one to your
offspring.

11
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:56,300
Each of the parents gave
one to their offspring.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,000
And that's how each offspring
gets two of them.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,239
That choice of which of the
two alleles to transmit to

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,790
your offspring is
a random draw.

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,470
And that explains beautifully,
for example, the 3-to-1

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,130
segregation pattern
that Mendel saw--

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,590
gorgeous.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,620
We put that model, which was
an ex post facto model, a

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,200
model made after the data were
available, to a test.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,100
You guys insisted we had to
test it before you would

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,280
publish it.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,910
And it holds up pretty well,
making pretty surprising

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,000
predictions that you
would otherwise

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,730
not have ever expected.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,660
Like amongst that 3 to 1, the
threes are not all the same.

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,430
Some of those round peas
were homozygous

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,060
for the big-R allele.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,910
And in selfing, they'll never
produce wrinkled peas.

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,310
But 2/3 of those round peas
were heterozygous.

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,070
And when you self them, you
get 1/4 wrinkled peas.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,170
So the wacky prediction that
1/3 of the rounds will give

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,050
rise to no wrinkleds, and 2/3
of the rounds will give rise

33
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,050
to 1/4 wrinkleds is a surprising
prediction and,

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,570
therefore, something that bears
stating as a scientific

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,491
prediction.

36
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:20,820
And so all those kind of
predictions can emerge.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,040
Then we turned to the question
of two factors.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,180
I'm practicing using
our words here--

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,800
homozygous, heterozygous,
alleles, et cetera.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,130
We now turn to two traits,
two phenotypes.

41
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,550
We have two phenotypes
segregating.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,270
We had round and wrinkled, and
we had green and yellow.

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,390
And Mendel determined, rather
brilliantly, that they

44
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,890
segregated, were transmitted
independently of each other.

45
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,850
There was no correlation between
which alleles you got

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,590
at round and which alleles
you got at wrinkled.

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,450
That was pretty cool.

48
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,480
Let's just go over that, because
there's a real tension

49
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:23,330
to be resolved because we have
Mendel's second law versus the

50
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,580
chromosome theory.

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,260
So Mendel's second law--

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,005
let's just go back to it-- in
the F0 generation, we had our

53
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:50,030
round green peas, genotype big
R, big R, big G, big G. We had

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:59,370
our wrinkled yellow peas,
genotype little r, little r,

55
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,430
little g, little g.

56
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,420
We cross them together, we get
F1 double heterozygotes, big

57
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,120
R, little r, big G, little g.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,850
We then perform a back cross
or test cross to the doubly

59
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,170
homozygous parent with the two
recessive phenotypes--

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,280
we're practicing
our words here.

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,680
And what do we get?

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,030
Well, we get certain options.

63
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,290
As we said, the gametes that
emerge from this parent on the

64
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,205
left could be of the
following types.

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,590
The gametes from the
parent on the right

66
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,120
are all those alleles--

67
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,230
Are those the recessive
alleles?

68
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,610
No.

69
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,140
You'll forget this over time,
but just to make me

70
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,000
comfortable--

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,460
they're actually the alleles
associated with the recessive

72
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,280
phenotype that we're
talking about.

73
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,830
Because you know-- but will
forget, I assure you, because

74
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,370
all my colleagues in the
biology department have

75
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,210
forgotten--

76
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,630
that they could also control
multiple other phenotypes,

77
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,760
some of which could
be dominant.

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,450
But that's OK.

79
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,070
I forgive you in advance
that you'll call

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,590
them recessive alleles.

81
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,520
Anyway, you get this.

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,673
And then these should occur at
equal frequency of one to one

83
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:24,923
to one to one.

84
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,871
All right.

85
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:36,420
Now, we had the chromosome
theory.

86
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,890
The chromosome theory, the
observation of the

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,260
choreography of chromosomes
during meiosis--

88
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,730
chromosomes in meiosis--

89
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,980
looks like this.

90
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,010
We have chromosomes lining
up in pairs.

91
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,490
Now, I'm not drawing
it terribly well.

92
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,220
But the two members of each
pair are of the same size.

93
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,890
But this pair could be
bigger, and this

94
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,900
pair could be smaller.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,920
It looks like they're really
finding each other.

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,620
These chromosomes are visibly
different in shape.

97
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,450
And so maybe I'll make this guy
a little longer, just to

98
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,020
indicate that, that
it actually knows.

99
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:24,390
Now an explanation, we said, for
how Mendel's second law of

100
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,330
independent assortment of two
different phenotypes could

101
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,665
occur is that, for
example - round.

102
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,130
It could be that the gene for
roundness is located on

103
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,030
chromosome number one.

104
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,460
These are two copies of
chromosome one that have been

105
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,050
duplicated, each of which
has the big-R allele.

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,930
Next to it, two copies of
chromosome one that have been

107
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,380
duplicated, each of them having
the little-r allele.

108
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,920
Over here on chromosome
number two.

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,760
let's say, lies the gene
for green or yellow.

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:17,270
And in this picture here, the
big G's are on the two copies

111
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,210
of this chromosome number
two that are here.

112
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,770
The little g's are on the two
copies of chromosome number

113
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,150
two that are here.

114
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:34,300
When the cell undergoes meiosis
one, we get to the

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:48,480
situation where we have big G,
big G; little g, little g.

116
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,650
We've got big R, big R;
little r, little r.

117
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,520
Could it have been the case
that the big G was on the

118
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,566
right and the little
g was on the left?

119
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,430
Yeah, of course.

120
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,620
It's totally independent
which way.

121
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,250
I happened to draw
it this way.

122
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,010
But with probability 50%,
it's the other way.

123
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,860
That's why they're independent
of each other.

124
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,950
And then when it undergoes
meiosis two that looks just

125
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:19,100
like mitosis, we end up with
our four gametes here.

126
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:41,390
Sorry, our four gametes with big
G, big G; little g, little

127
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:49,330
g; big R, big R; little
r, little r.

128
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,950
And that accounts for the big G,
big G; big R, big G; little

129
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,690
r, little g gametes.

130
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,600
And then when they went the
other way, the organism would

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,510
make a set of gametes that had
the other combination of big

132
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,610
R's with little g's.

133
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,530
So that's perfectly fine.

134
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,750
And because the second
chromosome is independently

135
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,030
ordered compared to the first
chromosome-- when they line up

136
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,220
at the midline, they
don't really care

137
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,390
which way they are--

138
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,960
that'll account for one
to one to one to one.

139
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,210
It's so straightforward.

140
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:40,190
But what happens if, instead,
both the roundness gene and

141
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,425
the greenness gene live on
the same chromosome?

142
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,390
We'll have little r,
little r there.

143
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:56,060
We'll have big G, big G here;
little g, little g.

144
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,150
And then when they split,
we'll end up with--

145
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,510
now, chromosome two has
nothing that we

146
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,500
care about on it.

147
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,395
It has a lot of genes.

148
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:12,050
In fact, there could be
chromosomes three, four, five.

149
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm just not drawing them.

150
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,290
But we're really going
to focus on

151
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,450
chromosome number one here.

152
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:26,520
And you'll notice that here on
chromosome one, the big G's or

153
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:34,760
the little g's are coupled,
physically coupled to each

154
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,150
other, the bigs with
the bigs and the

155
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,820
smalls with the smalls.

156
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:46,490
So now the kind of gametes that
can emerge from this will

157
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,410
only be big R, big G type or--

158
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,800
big G type--

159
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,270
or they'll be little
r, little g type.

160
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,980
We can't get the reverse
combination.

161
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,220
We can't get bigs and littles.

162
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:10,040
So this, because these are
independent of each other,

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:19,840
will get us one to one
to one to one.

164
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,170
These are the big, little,
and then these other

165
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,610
combinations like that.

166
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:39,070
This will get us only, if we
look at the big R, big G;

167
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,230
little r, little g; big R,
little g; little r, big G;

168
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,730
will get us one to one
to zero to zero.

169
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,490
Let's give a name to this type,
the big R's and the

170
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,920
little g's.

171
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,200
Let's call that a recombinant
type, OK?

172
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,760
I'm just going to use that
word for the moment.

173
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,570
The recombinant types-- the
bigs and the littles, and

174
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,690
littles and the bigs--

175
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,350
we're not going to
see any of them.

176
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,710
This is a very strong difference
between Mendel's

177
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,170
second law and the chromosome
theory.

178
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,030
If the chromosome theory is
right, and these chromosomes

179
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:19,240
are physical entities that have
integrity, they can't

180
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,240
both be right.

181
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,660
So that's a great thing in
science, when you have two

182
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,050
different models and they can't
both be right, because

183
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,210
you learn things then.

184
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,740
You can test them.

185
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,930
Now, Mendel tested this without
actually knowing the

186
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,400
chromosome theory.

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,490
And he always got one to one
to one to one for the seven

188
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,740
traits he looked at.

189
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,720
Was he just lucky that they
happened to lie on the seven

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,970
different chromosomes?

191
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
Or is there some problem
with this

192
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,340
chromosome theory, or what?

193
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,235
It took a while.

194
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,220
And then, of course, everybody
forgot about Mendel from 1865

195
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,920
until the year 1900.

196
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,210
In the year 1900, people begin
to rediscover Mendel.

197
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,010
Cytology has come along.

198
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,750
In January of the year 1900,
plant breeders start

199
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,000
rediscovering Mendel.

200
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,210
Sorry.

201
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,562
Thank you.

202
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,250
I see already.

203
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,670
Thank you.

204
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,910
I could tell by the look on your
face that something must

205
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,480
be wrong there.

206
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,030
Good.

207
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,860
Plant breeders start
rediscovering Mendel.

208
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,230
And in January of 1900, three
different groups say, you

209
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,710
know, we found these laws.

210
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,230
And they're just like
Mendel's laws--

211
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,680
which now everybody starts
paying attention to.

212
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,460
But plant breeding-- and people
tried to do mice, and

213
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,020
people tried to do rats.

214
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,770
What turned out to be the
winner, the place to really

215
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,980
study genetics, was
the fruit fly.

216
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,490
Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia
University decided, after he

217
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,610
was really frustrated wasting
years breeding mice and rats

218
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,930
that just took too long, around,
oh, I don't know, 1906

219
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,160
or something like that, began to
start breeding fruit flies.

220
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,020
Fruit flies are the teeny little
flies that when you

221
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,660
open a banana or fruits
or other kinds of

222
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
things, you'll see them.

223
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,250
And studying Drosophila gave us
the answer to this question

224
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,090
of what the problem is, how
can it be that either it's

225
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,930
independent or totally
dependent?

226
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,090
So we're going to talk about
Drosophila melanogaster, the

227
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,000
fruit fly, and the discovery
of recombination.

228
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,670
So now, Morgan--

229
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm going to now start using
fruit fly notation to give you

230
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,180
some practice with fruit
fly notation.

231
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,380
We're not going to use big
G's and little g's.

232
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,690
They like to refer to
the normal allele

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,120
and the mutant allele.

234
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,980
The normally allele is plus.

235
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,930
The mutant allele gets
some kind of a name.

236
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:19,940
And so he had a female fly that
was normal and normal at

237
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,880
two different loci, two
different genes.

238
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,330
I haven't told you what
the genes are.

239
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:30,240
And the male fly had a
black-colored body-- black

240
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,230
across its whole body--

241
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,700
and its wings were
shriveled and,

242
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,840
therefore, called vestigial.

243
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,570
So the phenotype here is black
and vestigial, black body and

244
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,400
vestigial wings.

245
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,620
And this wasn't the normal
appearance of a fly.

246
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,330
So he took these females by
these males, and he crossed

247
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,270
them together.

248
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,730
And he got an F1.

249
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,600
And the F1 was black over
vestigial, plus over plus.

250
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,050
And what was their phenotype?

251
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,720
Were they normal appearance,
which is kind of a

252
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,090
sandy-colored body
and normal wings?

253
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,820
Or were they this all black
body and vestigial wings?

254
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,940
Turns out they were normal.

255
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,100
From that, what do we infer
about these two traits, black

256
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,780
body and vestigial wings?

257
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,150
They're recessive traits.

258
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:37,030
So here, the phenotype was
normal appearance.

259
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,950
So then he crosses them back,
doing a test cross.

260
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,240
Let's say he'll take males here
and females here, but it

261
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,030
actually works either way.

262
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,440
And what he does is just
like we did there.

263
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,740
He could get gametes that
were black, vestigial.

264
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,480
He could get gametes that were
black, plus; plus, vestigial;

265
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,970
or plus, plus.

266
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,210
Those are the four possibilities
that come out.

267
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,160
So when he does it--
let's keep score.

268
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,488
I'm going to write them now--

269
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:18,390
plus, plus; black, vestigial.

270
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,245
And from the other parent,
you got this--

271
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,060
black, plus; black,
vestigial; plus,

272
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,310
vestigial; black, vestigial.

273
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,280
Those are the four
possibilities.

274
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,460
And if this was just like
Mendel's traits, it would be

275
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,970
one to one to one to one.

276
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,410
These were the parental
types that went in.

277
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,400
Plus, plus went in.

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,130
And black, vestigial went in.

279
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,690
Those were the combinations
of traits here.

280
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,490
These were new combinations.

281
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,240
What he observed--

282
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Let's see.

283
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,610
If Mendel's right, it'll be
one to one to one to one .

284
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,510
If the chromosome theory's
right, it'll be one to one to

285
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,750
zero to zero.

286
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,552
And who was right?

287
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,450
STUDENT: No one.

288
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,420
ERIC LANDER: No one.

289
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:18,080
The answer was 965 to
944 to 206 to 185.

290
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,540
Neither model was right.

291
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,060
Neither model's right.

292
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,180
The new combinations, the
recombinant combinations, the

293
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,490
non-parental combinations--

294
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,390
we can call these recombinant
combinations.

295
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,540
These were recombinant.

296
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,350
They recombined in some way.

297
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,390
They were a new combination,
or they were the

298
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,820
non-parental types.

299
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,290
We use both of those
words frequently--

300
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,990
were neither equal nor were
they completely absent.

301
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,850
They occurred, but at
a lower frequency.

302
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,950
What was the frequency?

303
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,060
Well, we could just add it up.

304
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:04,630
The frequency of recombinant
types, of new types of were

305
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:22,920
different than the
parents', is 17%.

306
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,280
What's going on?

307
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,770
Now, maybe this is some magic
number like the 3-to-1 ratio.

308
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,820
And you should look at that 17%
and say, ah, this is some

309
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,840
constant of the universe, that
when you put in traits you get

310
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,650
17% percent of recombinant
types.

311
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,490
But it takes a little judgment
to say, I don't think so.

312
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,940
And he actually tried
other traits.

313
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,410
And sometimes he got one
to one to one to one.

314
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,780
But very often he got
some funny number--

315
00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:00,030
6%, 28%, 1%.

316
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,090
There was some funny
business going on.

317
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,340
What's going on?

318
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,110
Recombination.

319
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,470
That's what's going
on is there is

320
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,290
recombination occurring.

321
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,573
What do we mean by
recombination?

322
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,510
Recombination is very important
stuff, by the way.

323
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,740
At some point, I will tell
you that understanding

324
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,870
recombination was actually
the origin of the

325
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,770
Human Genome Project.

326
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,210
And it traces back to
a good MIT story.

327
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,430
But that will be for a little
later in the semester.

328
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,010
So what do we think's
happening here?

329
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm now going to draw a close-up
of that chromosome.

330
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,640
And here's another chromosome,
the other pair.

331
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:04,280
And what we think here might be
happening is that you might

332
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:16,380
have plus and black;
black and plus--

333
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,700
oh, sorry.

334
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,920
Black, right?

335
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,316
Black, black; plus, plus.

336
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,990
This would be plus.

337
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,760
This would be plus.

338
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,970
This is the normal chromosome.

339
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,230
This is plus.

340
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:34,000
So this chromosome here
carries the pluses.

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,880
This guy here carries those
alleles black and vestigial.

342
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,780
Well, what happens, the idea
was that somehow these

343
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,810
chromosomes exchanged
material here.

344
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,860
And the chromosome that was
plus, plus; plus, plus now

345
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:03,290
somehow acquires that bit,
and this chromosome

346
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,810
somehow gets that bit.

347
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:19,510
And we end up instead with a
picture like this, where some

348
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,470
of this came from here.

349
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:34,960
And those two loci, black and
vestigial, were separated from

350
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,350
each other such that the black
allele moves over to that

351
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,400
chromosome.

352
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,200
Is that clear?

353
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,300
That's the notion.

354
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,510
Why did they think
this was true?

355
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,380
Well, it turns out that in fruit
flies, you can actually

356
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,250
look at eggs under
the microscope.

357
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,860
And you can look at
the chromosomes.

358
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,230
And if you take if you take
the cells, and you take a

359
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,010
cover slip, and you squash it
down with your finger, you can

360
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,180
actually see chromosomes lying
right over each other, making

361
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,250
little crosses like I drew
there, up there, called

362
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,650
chiasmata, which
means crosses.

363
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,310
And so people said, see, in the
microscope, you can see

364
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,990
they're lying on top
of each other.

365
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,540
Are you impressed by that
piece of evidence?

366
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,140
No.

367
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,640
You took the cover slip,
you squished it

368
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,470
down with your fingers.

369
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,400
So they're lying on
top of each other?

370
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,450
Big deal.

371
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm not going to be impressed.

372
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,890
And calling it chiasmata doesn't
make me any more

373
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,280
impressed, right?

374
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,430
Although it's always good to
call things Greek names,

375
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,850
because people think they're
more sophisticated if you call

376
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,920
them Greek names.

377
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,490
But this was the notion
people had.

378
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,600
And the frequency 17% would
indicate how often these

379
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,850
crossovers occur.

380
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,750
But if I were in the situation
we talked about with Mendel,

381
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,460
and I wrote this up, and I said,
see, it's 17% sometimes,

382
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,610
6% sometimes, 28% sometimes;
and when I look in the

383
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,440
microscope, they lie on top of
each other; therefore, it's

384
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,690
recombination--

385
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,310
There were actually other ideas
floating around too.

386
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,580
Maybe it has something to do
with developmental biology.

387
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,820
It was a puzzle.

388
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,370
When you have a really deep
puzzle, the most important

389
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,890
thing in science is to
find a young person.

390
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,960
Because young people come
without prejudice.

391
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,580
They say, let me just
look at all of this.

392
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,200
Stand back.

393
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,610
I don't come with
any prejudice.

394
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,310
So at MIT, what is the solution
when you have a

395
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,270
problem like this?

396
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,460
A UROP.

397
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,840
You want a UROP.

398
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,405
So even 1911, that was the
solution at Columbia.

399
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,970
Thomas Hunt Morgan got a UROP.

400
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm serious.

401
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,200
He was called Alfred
Sturtevant.

402
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,950
Alfred Sturtevant was a
sophomore at Columbia.

403
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,570
Everybody else was busy finding
this recombination

404
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,482
data, how often this recombined
with this, this

405
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:02,780
with this, this with this.

406
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,400
Sturtevant--

407
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,680
he's a sophomore--

408
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,050
he says, god, this stuff's
interesting!

409
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,690
Professor Morgan, could I
have all the data and

410
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,800
try to look at it?

411
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,760
Sturtevant took it home
and actually pulled an

412
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,810
all-nighter, blew off
his homework--

413
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,920
it actually says so in
his autobiography.

414
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,660
He says, I blew off my homework
and pulled an

415
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,370
all-nighter--

416
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,140
essentially in those words, he
says. "To the detriment of my

417
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,140
undergraduate homework"
is the way he puts it.

418
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:42,310
But in any case, genetic maps
and Sturtevant's all-nighter.

419
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,970
What Sturtevant did
was the following.

420
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:54,300
He said, how are we going to
prove the chromosome theory?

421
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,850
I like this idea that
recombination is about

422
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,950
distance on the chromosomes.

423
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,960
I like the concept that
maybe 17% is how often

424
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,800
these things recombine.

425
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,770
Why would things only recombine
1% of the time?

426
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,020
What would that mean?

427
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:16,400
They've got to be pretty close
together so that a crossover

428
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,130
between them happens
not so often.

429
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,660
And what if things
were far apart?

430
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,920
Well, it could be more likely.

431
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,310
So he likes the idea
that recombination

432
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,175
frequency means distance.

433
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,230
But how are you going
to prove that?

434
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,290
It could mean a zillion
other things.

435
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,090
It could mean biochemical
pathways,

436
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,930
developmental biology.

437
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,610
How are you going to prove that
recombination frequency

438
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,810
means distance?

439
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,500
You've got to make predictions,
right?

440
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,680
The only to do it would be
to make predictions.

441
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,960
So Sturtevant takes the data,
and he starts making

442
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,210
predictions.

443
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:04,150
I think, says Sturtevant,
these things are alleles

444
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,020
living at genes with locations
on the chromosome--

445
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,480
black, vestigial.

446
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,300
How often do black
and vestigial

447
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,350
recombine with each other?

448
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,940
What is the frequency
of recombinant

449
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,050
non-parental types?

450
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,360
17%.

451
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,860
So Sturtevant goes through the
data and he says, what about

452
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,265
other crosses people
did in the lab?

453
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:36,770
Well, it turns out people did
crosses with another mutant

454
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,730
that produces a funny eye color
called cinnabar, Cn.

455
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,020
So cinnabar.

456
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:55,010
It turns out that the
recombination frequency

457
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:07,310
between cinnabar to
vestigial was 8%.

458
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,620
Vestigial, cinnabar,
8% recombination.

459
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,640
If this chromosome business
is right, where

460
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,890
should I put cinnabar?

461
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,160
Sorry?

462
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,084
Where do you want it?

463
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:21,900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

464
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,920
ERIC LANDER: Somewhere
in between.

465
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,570
You'd like me to
put that there.

466
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,920
STUDENT: On the other side.

467
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,420
ERIC LANDER: Oh, OK.

468
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,940
Wait a second.

469
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,361
On the other side.

470
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,430
OK, which is it?

471
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,765
How many vote for the left?

472
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:37,080
How many vote for the right?

473
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,510
How many conscientious
abstainers are there?

474
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,930
Do we know?

475
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,850
STUDENT: No.

476
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,180
ERIC LANDER: No.

477
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,880
There are two possibilities.

478
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,160
It could be 8% this way, or
it could be 8% that way.

479
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,410
How are we going to know?

480
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,223
Yes?

481
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:57,150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

482
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,990
ERIC LANDER: Black.

483
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,750
What if we knew the answer
between cinnabar and black?

484
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,340
That would constrain
the problem.

485
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,040
Can you give me two predictions
for what the

486
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,282
answer might be?

487
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:08,520
STUDENT: Either 9% or--

488
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,310
ERIC LANDER: Either 9% or 25%.

489
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,430
So now we have a prediction.

490
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,570
We don't know where
cinnabar is.

491
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,580
But the answer could be that
black to vestigial should

492
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,990
either be about 9%--

493
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,660
that's what that
would be here--

494
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:32,140
or about 25%.

495
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,390
The answer?

496
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,270
About 9%.

497
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,430
That's what Sturtevant found.

498
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,900
That's a prediction
and kind of cool.

499
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,230
And you can imagine taking the
data home and it's probably 9

500
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,780
o'clock, and you've
now realized, wow,

501
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,320
freaky, it's 9%.

502
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,430
So then he looked at the
mutation "lobe." Lobe was

503
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,440
another mutation.

504
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,530
The lobe mutation showed 5%
recombination from vestigial.

505
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,200
Where should we put it?

506
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,230
Left or right, well, let's
make some predictions.

507
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,220
Suppose it's over here.

508
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,360
Will it be very close
to cinnabar?

509
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,025
Will it be closer to black?

510
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:39,990
But what if it was over here?

511
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,890
Well, it would be further.

512
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,940
So let's put lobe in.

513
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,960
And suppose we know
that lob is 5%.

514
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,665
Then what's the prediction
for black to lobe?

515
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,660
22%.

516
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:09,090
Answer, according to the
notebooks, 21%, pretty close.

517
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,550
You'd like it to
be exactly 22.

518
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,020
But life doesn't always
turn out that way.

519
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,760
21's pretty close to 22.

520
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,150
What other predictions
could we make?

521
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,540
If this is cinnabar here, could
you give me a prediction

522
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,620
for cinnabar to lobe?

523
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,450
13%.

524
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,540
Yep, that works.

525
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,790
Curved wing.

526
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,640
Recombination distance
from lobed, 3%.

527
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,950
So now you have some
predictions.

528
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,460
You have this prediction here.

529
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,180
You predict 8%.

530
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,250
Answer, about 8%.

531
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,660
Over here you predict 16%.

532
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,730
Answer, about 16%.

533
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,100
Bingo.

534
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,960
Sturtivant says, if
these genes--

535
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,670
we call them loci, often.

536
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,610
I'll use the word locus
synonymous with gene.

537
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,370
Locus means a place.

538
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,820
And geneticists think about
genes as a place on a

539
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,540
chromosome.

540
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,320
If these loci--

541
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,570
the plural of locus-- if these
loci were really arrayed along

542
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,760
a linear structure, then it
would have to be the case that

543
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,380
they would have certain
additive

544
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,750
relationships between them.

545
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,810
And the chance that they would
have these additive

546
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,900
relationships if they weren't
part of a line is pretty

547
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,820
implausible.

548
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:39,130
That's a real prediction, a very
remarkable prediction.

549
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,420
And it holds up with the data.

550
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,260
Sturtivant pulls the
all-nighter.

551
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,090
By the time the sun comes up at
Columbia University-- this

552
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,700
is Morningside Heights--

553
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,360
he's got the whole
thing worked out.

554
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,340
Yes, this chromosome theory
must be right.

555
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,520
It fits beautifully
all of these data.

556
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,760
Pretty cool.

557
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,220
You are all authorized to blow
off your homework anytime you

558
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,032
make a discovery like that.

559
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,740
[LAUGHTER]

560
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,030
That's a course rule.

561
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,230
Any homework will
be forgiven for

562
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,080
discoveries of that magnitude.

563
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,810
All right.

564
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,060
Tell your TAs.

565
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,770
So now, what does it
really tell us?

566
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,565
It tells us that if genes are
very close together, the

567
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:35,730
recombination frequency, R
recombination frequency, or

568
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,260
RF, might be very little.

569
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,660
They could be as low as almost
zero, which means you never

570
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,760
see a recombinant because
they're right

571
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,130
next to each other.

572
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,800
Or it could be that they're
further apart.

573
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,990
It might be 1%.

574
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,950
It might be 10%.

575
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,100
It could keep growing.

576
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,250
It might be 30%.

577
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,100
Suppose it's way, way, way,
way, way far away.

578
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,360
What's the largest it
ever gets to be?

579
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,020
Well, if they were on different
chromosomes--

580
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,310
suppose there were totally
independent segregation,

581
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,889
different chromosomes--

582
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,790
what would they be?

583
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,238
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

584
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,982
ERIC LANDER: No, it's 50%
because remember, one to one

585
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:19,969
to one to one says that
the recombinant--

586
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,090
well, actually, this is an
interesting question.

587
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,000
Let's come to that 100.

588
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,300
On different chromosomes, one
to one to one to one means

589
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,489
that it's 50%, half of them
are recombinant types.

590
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,469
It turns out on the same
chromosome, as you get farther

591
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,730
and farther and farther, you
might say there's going to be

592
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,290
100% chance of a crossover.

593
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,110
And you might say the
recombination frequency could

594
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,010
keep growing past 50%.

595
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,380
It turns out it doesn't.

596
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,150
The reason is that multiple
crossovers can happen.

597
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,060
So mathematical interjection
here, if here's my gene and

598
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,760
here's my gene, there could
be one crossover.

599
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,400
There could be two crossovers.

600
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,110
There could be three
crossovers.

601
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,620
And so in fact, it turns out, as
you get very far away, you

602
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,390
have to start paying attention
to the probabilities of double

603
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,680
crossovers and triple
crossovers.

604
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
And so it turns out that it's
a Poisson process of the

605
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,240
number of crossovers that
occurs, give or take.

606
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,490
And you see a recombination
if there's an odd number.

607
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,470
And for that reason, it
never gets above 50%.

608
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,680
So as the distance gets further
and further and

609
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,740
further, it goes from zero to
50, which is the same number

610
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,760
you get for separate
chromosomes.

611
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,620
Otherwise, you might think that
if there was just one

612
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,540
crossover, it gets to 100%
probability of recombination.

613
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,360
But it never does, because
there are doubles.

614
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,960
And you can actually observe,
if you make a cross that has

615
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,560
three different genes
segregating in it, you can

616
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,380
actually see the double
crossover type.

617
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,400
So you can see very nicely
that if you make a cross

618
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:03,650
involving black, cinnabar, and
vestigial over plus, plus,

619
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,710
plus, you can see that cinnabar
is right in the

620
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,870
middle because this
recombination happens at a

621
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,930
pretty good frequency.

622
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,430
This recombination happens at
a good frequency, giving you

623
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,860
plus, cinnabar, vestigial
or black, plus, plus.

624
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,060
Sometimes you will get
that recombination.

625
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,320
You'll get out gametes that are
black, plus, vestigial,

626
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,280
but at a much lower frequency
because they take two

627
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,230
crossovers.

628
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,490
What will be the probability
of seeing a

629
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,600
black, cinnabar, vestigial?

630
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,940
Well, we said that this
one was about 9%, this

631
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,040
one was about 8%.

632
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,980
What's the product of a 9%
chance and an 8% chance?

633
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,000
It's about a 1% chance, a little
less than a 1% chance.

634
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,520
That how frequently you see
black, plus, vestigial.

635
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,170
You can even predict the
probability of a double

636
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,160
crossover event by multiplying
the two events

637
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,660
that have to happen.

638
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,940
So your bottom-line rules here
is that because of these

639
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,410
double crossovers our
recombination frequency can go

640
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:15,640
from zero to about 50%.

641
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,910
This is independent
assortment.

642
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,650
And it either occurs if you're
on different chromosomes or,

643
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,015
if you're very far away on the
same chromosome, they behave

644
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:31,260
as if they're independent
of each other.

645
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,570
Any questions about
any of that?

646
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,563
Yes?

647
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:36,535
STUDENT: Why didn't Mendel
ever see recombination?

648
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:38,470
ERIC LANDER: Why didn't Mendel
ever see recombination?

649
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,710
It turns out that with seven
chromosomes, and they're

650
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,380
biggish in length, he never
actually ran into two loci

651
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,150
that were close enough,
to notice it.

652
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,170
That's why.

653
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,320
Flies actually only have three
major chromosomes.

654
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
There's a fourth, but it's
a puny little thing.

655
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,440
And because they were much more
intensively collecting

656
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,810
mutations in Morgan's fly room,
they began having a lot

657
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,110
of them, and they
had to bump into

658
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,960
recombination pretty early.

659
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,670
Mendel simply didn't have enough
that were close enough.

660
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,770
Think about what would have
happened if just by chance,

661
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,790
somebody were selling a strain
of peas in the market which

662
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,310
had a mutation in a locus that
had 10% recombination

663
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,200
distance, and it screwed up
Mendel's law of independent

664
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,560
assortment of two loci?

665
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
Mendel might not have
published the paper.

666
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,450
Sometimes in science it's
actually valuable to first get

667
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,520
the oversimplification out ,
like his second law, and then

668
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,650
deal with the complexity
that sits on top of the

669
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,030
oversimplification.

670
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,810
It's kind of lucky that Mendel
didn't have enough of them to

671
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,620
be bothered, in the
first paper.

672
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,680
So in fact, all of Mendel's
seven loci

673
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,440
have now been mapped.

674
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,120
Most have been cloned
molecularly.

675
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,470
And so we actually know where
they are, et cetera.

676
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,790
It's a really good question.

677
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,240
That's sort of why he didn't.
