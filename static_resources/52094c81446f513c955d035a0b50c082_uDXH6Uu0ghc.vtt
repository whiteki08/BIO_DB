00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.445
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.390
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.000
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.650
So today--

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.860
I haven't seen you in a while.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.930
Anyway, today, we're going to
turn back to our picture,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.270
function gene protein.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.530
We filled in genetics.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.390
We filled in biochemistry.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.540
We've now got the connection
between gene and protein

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.520
through molecular biology.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.450
We know gene encodes protein.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.730
We know central dogma,
DNA goes to the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.560
RNA goes to the protein.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.100
We know all that in theory.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.820
In fact, people knew this by
the middle of the 1960s.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.720
People were so excited that they
understood the idea of

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.130
how genes give rise to proteins
through transcription

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.890
and translation, they read the
genetic code, that they

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.620
declared victory.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.690
Some of them said, done with
the secret of life.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.560
Let's go on and do the brain.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.990
That was actually the thinking
of a lot of the great

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.380
molecular biologists
in the late 1960s.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.740
Let's go do the brain.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.780
Why did they say such a thing?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.100
Well, because they
thought they were

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.170
done with the problem.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.440
They thought that once you knew
in principle how a gene

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.980
gave rise to a protein,
you could do it.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.220
But in practice, nobody could
read a single gene.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.960
Nobody could even identify
a single gene.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.980
Maybe that's why they went on
to say, let's go study the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.620
brain, because they actually
weren't sure what they could

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.600
do past that point.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.170
All right.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.430
So wait a second,
wait a second.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.440
I said nobody could even
purify a single gene.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.661
Didn't we talk about purifying
the genetic material?

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.910
You're supposed to say
yes at that point.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.580
Yes, right?

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.630
We talked about that.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.590
Avery, McCarty, MacLeod-- we
purified the genetic material.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.876
We did it by using this
assay of transforming.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.220
So what do I mean by we can't
purify a single gene?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.610
What I mean is that we can
purify the hereditary material

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.670
away from everything else, but
we get all of it together.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.800
We don't get individual genes
separated from each other.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.250
We get the whole mixture
of all the genes,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.550
all the genetic material.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.910
As a biochemist, how are we
going to ever separate the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.240
gene encoding--

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.520
oh I don't know, ARG1, our
favorite gene for arginine

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.580
biosynthesis--

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.670
from the gene encoding
ARG2, for example?

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.500
What kind of biochemistry
can we do to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.880
separate these two genes?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.660
Do they have different
biochemical properties?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.350
What's so different about
ARG1 and ARG2?

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.504
What's their different
biochemical properties?

00:03:09.504 --> 00:03:11.790
They're both DNA.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.100
They have exactly the same
building blocks, slightly

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.180
different order.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.350
You think you have a
purification procedure, I'm

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.800
going to run it over some column
and separate it by

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.040
something that's going to
separate ARG1 from ARG2?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.570
No.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.250
From the point of view of a
pure biochemist, they look

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.800
exactly the same.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.920
All the different genes have
the same biochemical

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.440
properties.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.320
How in the world would we ever
purify ARG1 from ARG2, or in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.830
the human, the gene encoding
hemoglobin from the gene

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.120
encoding collagen from the gene
encoding keratin from the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.130
gene encoding anything else?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.670
Think about it.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.920
That's a tough problem.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.970
There is a brilliant solution
that arose in the 1970s to how

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.330
we could purify the individual
genes away from each other.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.180
But it's like no other piece
of biochemistry anybody had

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.870
ever seen before.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.080
It has a totally different
principle behind it.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.860
Because it isn't just
fractionating things according

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.550
to their biochemical
properties.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.410
It involves something else.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.100
And it's called cloning.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.990
It is called cloning.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.095
Molecular cloning.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:25.520
You see, the problem is this.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.350
The human genome--

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.760
how big is the human genome?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.630
How many bases?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.630
Three billion bases, three
times 10 to the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.440
ninth bases, right?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.150
How big is a typical
human gene?

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.380
A typical human gene might
be 30,000 bases.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.610
How big is a typical mutation
that we might want to find in

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.340
a typical gene, like causing
sickle cell anemia?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.290
One base.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.580
We've got to purify out genes
that are one part in 10 to the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.660
fifth and mutations that
are one part in 10 to

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.972
the ninth or so.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.680
And how are we going
to do that?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
Well, the trick is this.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.010
I'll give you the quick
overview, and then we'll spend

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.180
today looking at it.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.150
Step one is we cut up our DNA.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:32.790
We cut DNA at defined sites, and
we then paste the DNA to

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.520
distinct molecules
called vectors.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.640
These vectors have a cool
property, that when you take a

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.360
vector and you insert in it a
piece of DNA, that vector is

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.880
able to grow in another
organism.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.840
You then transform the DNA--

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.970
that's transfer, we use the
word transform the DNA--

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.550
into something like E. coli,
where you get your little

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.490
vector in there.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.110
It grows within E. coli, and as
E. coli divides, it makes

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.680
copies of itself.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:23.750
And then you select those
bacteria that have received,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:31.430
that have been transformed, grow
them up on a petri plate

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.460
so that you have little
colonies.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.620
And then you screen
the colonies.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.040
Now, what do I mean?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.960
We cut the DNA.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.020
We paste the DNA.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.750
We transform the DNA.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.200
We select the bacteria that
have been successfully

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.090
transformed.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.610
And we screen the resulting
colonies to find what we're

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.510
looking for.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.420
Now, notice--

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.990
that amazing trick here is when
we cut up the DNA into

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.910
single molecules, lots and lots
of single molecules, and

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.460
we paste them into vectors,
and we transform them into

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.880
bacteria, each one of those
bacteria gets exactly one

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.450
molecule, give or take.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.930
It gets one piece
of human DNA.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.810
We then spread them out on a
plate and they grow up, and

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.840
each one grows up
copies for us of

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.020
individual pieces of DNA.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.420
That is so cool.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.120
Because we've just accomplished
biochemical

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.790
purification.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.850
It's not based on any different
properties of the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.190
individual molecules.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.060
It's based on the fact that
we dilute them, in effect.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.800
They're diluted, and
one molecule

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.620
ends up in each bacteria.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.440
So they're purified
in that sense.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.980
And then when that bacteria
grows up, everything it grows

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.620
up is a pure copy, a copy of
that single piece of DNA that

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.020
went into it.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.030
That's a different kind
of purification.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.840
When I'm done-- and we'll go
through this whole process.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.365
That's the point of today's
lecture, is to go through the

00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:56.880
whole process.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.770
When I'm done, I have
bacteria spread out.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.260
And right over there, one of
these guys has ARG1, and one

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.740
of these guys has ARG2, and one
of these guys has ARG10.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.800
Now, admittedly, I don't know
which one has which, but I've

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.740
accomplished the purification.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.070
I'll then have to figure out
how to screen and find out

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.300
which one is which, but I have
separated the molecules away

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.950
from each other by this process
of cloning, diluting

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.540
them in a way--

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.530
one molecule per bacteria--

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.961
and growing them back up.

00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:26.300
I could do this for anything.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.690
I could dilute proteins down
into test tubes that had one

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.919
protein molecule per test tube,
and I could say I've

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.100
accomplished purification.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.110
The problem with it is I have
no way to replicate those

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.320
proteins to get a meaningful
amount of it.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.480
But when it's DNA, and I've put
it back into a bacteria, I

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.020
have a way to grow it back up.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.730
And that's why this
trick works--

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.940
is because DNA is a molecule
that can replicate.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.550
No other molecule has
that cool property.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.500
And so you can pull
this off for DNA.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.050
All right.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.160
Now we have to dive in to
understand how this could

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.410
possibly work.
