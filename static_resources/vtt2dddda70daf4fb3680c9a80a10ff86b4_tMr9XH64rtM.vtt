WEBVTT

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.840
PROFESSOR: Now, onward.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.840
Transcription.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:29.680
So, we've got DNA, we'll do two,
three, probably three by

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.930
now, transcription.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.430
So we have DNA goes to DNA.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.470
DNA makes RNA, RNA
makes protein.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.210
This, by the way, gets the
name the central dogma of

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.460
molecular biology.

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:06.070
Due to Francis Crick, and as
an aside, Francis actually

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.780
never said DNA goes to
RNA goes to protein.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.610
What he said was nucleic
acids go to protein.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.180
The information flows from
nucleic acids to proteins.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.800
He never actually said DNA goes
to RNA goes to protein,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.640
and that's an important point.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.600
And we'll come to it at some
point, probably next time.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.850
So, transcription.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.220
Here's my genome.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.170
Here's my double helix.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.050
I'm going to stop wrapping
around itself, just because

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.530
it's tedious.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.150
And here's a chunk of DNA
that encodes a gene.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.680
Maybe it's a gene that makes
our enzyme for arginine

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.580
biosynthesis.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.105
Remember, we had our arginine
genes and all that.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:51.090
But what happens is it has a
starting point, it has a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340
stopping point.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480
Five prime to three prime.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.520
What happens is there is a
signal in the DNA that the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.970
cell knows how to read
called a promoter.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.000
And under certain circumstances,
this promoter

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.910
invites an enzyme to sit down,
and the enzyme starts copying.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.620
Which direction does
this enzyme go?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.960
Five prime to three prime.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040
They all go five prime
to three prime.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.290
But it makes RNA.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.570
Okay?

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.570
And then it gets to certain
point, and it stops copying.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.600
This process of copying is
called transcription, because

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.390
it's just a direct
transcribing.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.280
So what's the difference
between DNA and RNA?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.710
Two differences.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.310
One, this is two prime
deoxyribose.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.290
This is ribose.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.240
It's not two prime deoxy.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.830
It's truly ribose.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.240
The other difference, where DNA
has T, RNA, has U, uracil.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.580
The difference, what's the
difference between T and U?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.660
The difference is
a methyl group.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.020
It's a methyl group in an
unimportant position for the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.160
base paring.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.590
It doesn't matter.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.800
It has an extra methyl group.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.530
You can look it up
in your book.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.310
So for all practical purposes,
you, in thinking about

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.170
polymerization and five prime
to three prime, and

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.510
everything, could imagine the
DNA and RNA are the same basic

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.840
structure, because it's got one
little methyl group that

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.660
distinguishes T and U. And it's
got a hydroxyl on the two

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.840
prime position in the carbon,
in the sugar, which actually

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840
isn't anything we use.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.410
We never use the two prime.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.660
So none of what I've told you is
affected by t versus u, or

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.960
deoxyribose versus ribose.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.610
Now, it turns out it does
make a difference

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.620
in the overall structure.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.785
It's harder to base pair with
the ribose there as opposed to

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:10.820
the deoxyribose because they
stack differently, et cetera.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.070
It makes a difference
to the cell.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.710
RNA is less stable, all
sorts of things.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.339
But for your practical purposes,
apart from having to

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.290
know that it's T versus U, and
deoxyribose versus ribose, you

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.720
won't see in this course
actually see any real strong

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.490
reasons why it matters, but it
does matter to the cell.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.660
All right.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.680
So this enzyme comes along, and
it copies a segment of the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.810
DNA, starting at a promoter.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.400
It knows which strand it's on.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.500
Remember, this is stranded.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.760
It's not like it's going
back this way.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.130
It has a directionality to it.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.020
And in reaches what's called a
transcriptional stop signal.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.320
Transcriptional stop, which is a
certain sequence in the DNA,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.010
and it comes to an end.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.490
And it makes an RNA transcript,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.010
which then floats away.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.550
Which we'll talk
next time, gets

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.100
translated into a protein.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.900
And how do you think
this works?

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.590
It takes nucleotides, RNA
nucleotides here, with their

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.460
triphosphates, and sticks them
on, just like we saw with DNA.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.860
And it makes a polymer of RNA.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.660
And the enzyme is called
RNA polymerase, right?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.110
This is all pretty
logical stuff.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:35.450
RNA polymerase comes along
and does that.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.760
So we get RNA polymerase.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:57.080
Now, when I am a cell, and this
is my genome, I have a

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.010
gene that goes this way.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.010
Here's its promoter, here's
its transcriptional stop.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.160
I could also have a gene
that goes this way.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.410
Here's its promoter, here's
its transcriptional stop.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.660
Directionality could go
in either direction.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.200
RNA polymerase comes along, and
with the help of friends,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.900
knows where to start.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.170
Those friends could be other
proteins that are sitting down

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.110
there that RNA polymerase
likes to associate with.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.340
And which strand is
being transcribed?

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.460
The bottom strand, or
the top strand?

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.240
Matters.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.660
You get a different single
stranded RNA.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.850
So RNA, when it floats off,
is single stranded.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:52.080
This is going to make a single
stranded RNA that, five prime

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.260
to three prime RNA that is
complimentary to, matching to,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.140
the bottom.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.590
This guy, however, will make an
RNA that is complimentary

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.840
to the top.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.170
Much of the business of running
your cell is figuring

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.240
out which genes you should
be transcribing into RNA.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.990
It turns out your liver is
making different transcripts.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.890
It's transcribing different
segments of your genome than

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.760
say, a muscle cell.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.700
Than say, a brain cell.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.470
All of that machinery of
figuring out how one genome

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.740
gets read out in different ways
by RNA polymerase is the

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.470
problem of gene regulation.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.370
And we will talk about that
in a little while.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.930
What we're going to talk about
next time is how that RNA

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.910
transcript gets translated
into a protein.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.430
And you guys probably,
again, all know this.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.370
But nonetheless, we'll talk
a little bit about it.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.230
And then we'll talk about some
variations on that theme.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.480
Until next time.
