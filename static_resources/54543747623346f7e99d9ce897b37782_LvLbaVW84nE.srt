00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,610
PROFESSOR: Hello, and welcome
to a help session on

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,910
complementation.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,300
Today, we are going
to be working

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,120
out a problem together.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,600
If you have not yet had a chance
to work out the problem

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,370
on your own, please do so now,
and then return to this video.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,790
All right, now that you've had
a chance to look at the

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,850
problem your on, let's
work it out together.

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,820
So, here we have a series of
different fruit flies.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,900
They all have these recessive
mini-fly phenotypes.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,460
So, we've noticed that
there are lots

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,140
of different mutations.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,870
And, now, we would like
to put them into

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,930
complementation groups.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,990
So, we start off by looking at
this nice, large Punnett

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,620
square we have, where all the
flies have been crossed to

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,200
each other.

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,690
So, if we look at A and B for
instance, when these two flies

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,410
are crossed together,
they still

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,670
have a mini-fly phenotype.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,450
This means that the mutation is
in the same gene and that

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,300
these two mutants do not
complement each other, but

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,950
they make up one complementation
group.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,630
So if we look farther down this
column, A and F together

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,980
also have a mini-fly
phenotype.

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,730
This means A, B, and F, all
three of these are in the same

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,980
complementation group.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,240
So, now that we've already
looked at A and B, let's

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,800
continue on to C. So, C has a
normal fly in all of these

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,710
instances except this one.

31
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,570
When C and E are crossed
together, they also have a

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,430
mini-fly phenotype.

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,920
Thus, C and E also form a
complementation group.

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,946
So, now we're done with A,B, C,
E, and F. So looking at D,

35
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:21,600
D when crossed to all the other
flies, you never get a

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,870
mini-fly phenotype.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,760
So, D must be in its own
complementation group.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,730
Great, so we've identified all
three complementation groups.

39
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,910
So, moving on to the next
part of the problem.

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,650
We are asked, are mutations B
and C in the same gene, or are

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,210
they in different genes?

42
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:55,210
All right, so, if we look over
here at B and C together, when

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,740
these are crossed, we
get a normal fly.

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,570
This means that the mutations
were able to

45
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,430
complement each other.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,130
Meaning that the two mutations
occur in different genes, and,

47
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,500
thus, when you cross the
flies, they're able to

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,590
compensate for each other.

49
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,395
So, they're in different
genes.

50
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,590
All right, now, in the last
part of the problem, we're

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,260
told that we are introduced to
a new fly, or a new mutant

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,690
fly, G. When G is crossed
to A, we get a

53
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,930
mini-fly phenotype out.

54
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,900
Also, when we cross G to B, we
also get a mini-fly phenotype.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,300
So the question is, what
does this suggest to us

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,480
about mutant G?

57
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,470
Looking over here, we notice
that A and B are in the same

58
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,890
complementation group.

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,720
When A and B are crossed
together, we also get

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,690
mini-flies So, this suggests
to us that G is yet another

61
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,150
member of this complementation
group.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,510
Thus, G also falls into
complementation

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,280
group number one.

64
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,460
This concludes our help problem
on complementation.

65
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,710
Thank you for joining us.
