1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,890
PROFESSOR: Good morning,
good morning.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:23,570
So last time, we talked about
the most remarkable

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,260
biochemical purification
procedure ever invented--

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,510
cloning.

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,230
You remember the issue
with biochemistry.

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,120
You're going to grind up a cell,
you're going to take the

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,210
contents and run it over
different kinds of separation

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,660
columns or centrifuge it or
things, in order to separate

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,970
some things from other things.

10
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,300
The problem with purifying a
gene that way, away from all

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,950
the rest of DNA in a cell, is
that the gene has exactly the

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,940
same biochemical properties
as all the other genes.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,790
How in the world are
you going to do it?

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,380
The solution was devilishly
simple and devilishly complex

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,620
at the same time.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,200
All you have to do to purify
something is dilute it.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,630
If I take any substance
an I add enough

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,280
water, it's very dilute.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,966
And in any little drop in any
little test tube there will

20
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,470
only be one DNA molecule.

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,480
It's now purified.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,130
I could do that for every
molecule there is.

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,550
The problem is, it's not very
useful unless I have a way to

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:40,270
take that molecule and make
extra copies of it.

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,700
But if I could do that, dilution
is purification.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,490
The trick we use initially for
making more copies is we ask

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,940
E. coli to do it for us.

28
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,680
That, as usual, is the solution
to most issues.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,390
Find something in life
that already does it.

30
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,360
And so, just to remember what
we did, we took total DNA.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Maybe it was yeast DNA, maybe
it was human DNA, maybe

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,130
it was zebra DNA.

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,840
And we cut it up with some
restriction enzyme.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,570
Our restriction enzyme we used
was EcoR1 And it therefore cut

35
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,560
at the EcoR1 sites, G, A, A, T,
T, C. We could have used a

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,670
different restriction enzyme.

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,850
We then added it to a vector.

38
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,420
The vector was cut open
at an EcoR1 site.

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,370
The vector had an origin of
replication, ORI, and the

40
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:53,030
vector had a resistance marker,
some resistance gene

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,740
that made a protein that could
break down some antibiotic

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,120
found in nature.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,875
We combine these two pieces.

44
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,520
Vector now gets its insert.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,670
We call this vector, we
call this insert.

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,292
We attach them together
using what?

47
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:16,720
AUDIENCE: Ligase.

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,280
PROFESSOR: Ligase, the enzyme
that ligates DNA.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,030
We then take this, we transform
it into a bacterium.

50
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,860
The scale is obviously
off, right?

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,750
This DNA plasmid here is tiny
compared to this bacteria.

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,400
But if I draw it to scale,
it won't be very helpful.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,640
So we then transform
it in here.

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
We do that in a test tube.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,310
We treat the bacteria a little
roughly so it likes to slurp

56
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,640
up the DNA.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,650
We then plate it on a plate.

58
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,670
And those bacteria that have
acquired our plasmid

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,800
containing the antibiotic
resistance gene are able to

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,600
grow on this plate that
has antibiotic on it.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,670
And we call this thing
a library.

62
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,320
So that's it.

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,769
We can make a library.

64
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,329
And we have in effect,
then, what I said.

65
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,400
We've deluded the individual
molecules out, and each one

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,010
went into its own bacteria, and
each one got replicated by

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,260
that bacteria.

68
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,530
Those plasmids are replicated
by the bacteria.

69
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,090
In fact, we choose plasmids
that are called multicopy

70
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,320
plasmids, where there's not
just one copy but the cell

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,980
might make 50 copies of it.

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,070
We grow up a whole colony
of it and there you go.

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,490
We talked about some of
the issues with it.

74
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,650
Where do we get the restriction
enzymes, the

75
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,830
ligases, the vectors,
et cetera?

76
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,440
It's in the catalog, right?

77
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,940
We used to purify them
ourselves, but they're all in

78
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,430
the catalog.

79
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,500
So any questions about this?

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,350
We had some questions.

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,540
I have a question about this.

82
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,860
How come when we add ligase the
vector itself just doesn't

83
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,190
close up into a circle without
an insert in it?

84
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,520
It might.

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,346
What would happen then?

86
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,780
AUDIENCE: You'd just have
your original vector.

87
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,890
PROFESSOR: You'd just have
your original vector.

88
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,174
And what happens when I
transform into the bacteria?

89
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,620
AUDIENCE: It'll still survive.

90
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,050
PROFESSOR: It'll
still survive.

91
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,920
So will the unimolecular closure
of that circle be more

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,120
common than the bimolecular
interaction between a vector

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,330
and an insert?

94
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,685
AUDIENCE: Probably.

95
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,500
PROFESSOR: Probably, because the
two ends of the circle are

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,480
pretty close to each other.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,422
So what do I do?

98
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:46,418
Yeah?

99
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:47,912
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE]

100
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,904
are the same.

101
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:50,277
[INAUDIBLE]

102
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,643
same restriction enzymes
because if they're two

103
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,400
different enzymes so
they don't match.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,970
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

105
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,320
That's cute trick.

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,620
Two different restriction
enzymes so that

107
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,090
they couldn't reclose.

108
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,640
But then my fragments better
have those two different

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,530
sites, too, and only be able to
clone those fragments that

110
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,550
have the two different ones.

111
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,470
But that could work.

112
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,730
So you want a trick for making
sure it doesn't reclose.

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,780
Any other tricks?

114
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,535
But the problem is, I won't get
all the fragments, only

115
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:20,020
the ones that have, say,
an Eco at a Bam site.

116
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,910
But that's--

117
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,140
So I bring this up not because
it's particularly important,

118
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,220
but to tell you the kind of
engineering that really does

119
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
have to go on in molecular
biology.

120
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,080
What happens is when you have
your DNA put in here, we have

121
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,590
a sugar-phosphate backbone
in both cases.

122
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,430
And if we look up close, one
of these sides has the

123
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,210
phosphate, the other
has a hydroxyl.

124
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,830
Phosphate, hydroxyl, phosphate,
hydroxyl, right?

125
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,640
And ligase comes in
and joins that.

126
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,680
So this guy has a phosphate on
this strand, and this guy has

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,980
a phosphate on that
strand, hydroxyl

128
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,630
there, hydroxyl there.

129
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,000
What would happen if
I got rid of the

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,580
phosphates on the vector?

131
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,570
Could it reclose?

132
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,540
AUDIENCE: No.

133
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,000
PROFESSOR: No.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,770
So if there were an enzyme that
removed phosphates, I

135
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,410
could treat my vector
first with the

136
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,530
phosphate-removing enzyme.

137
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,420
And now it couldn't possibly
reclose on itself.

138
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,180
And is there such an enzyme?

139
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,150
And what's it called?

140
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,710
Phosphatase, because it takes
phosphates so easy.

141
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,830
Phosphatase, it takes
off the phosphates.

142
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,360
And then it can't
reclose anymore.

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,900
And where do we get
phosphatase?

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,700
It's in the catalog.

145
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,740
Exactly.

146
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,220
So now what happens
is that the vector

147
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,850
only has an OH here.

148
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,030
What happens to ligase?

149
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,160
When I put an insert in here,
ligase can make a covalent

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,230
join on this strand.

151
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,170
But it can't actually
make a covalent join

152
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,080
on the other strand.

153
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,580
But does it matter?

154
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,260
No, because I've closed up my
circle on that strand, and I

155
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,390
close up the circle there on the
other strand, and I just

156
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,840
throw it into E. coli.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,510
And you know what happens when
it goes into E. coli?

158
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,370
It's got a nick, obviously,
on that strand.

159
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,500
It hasn't closed up.

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,270
But what does E. coli do
when it sees that DNA?

161
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,860
Must be damaged DNA.

162
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,540
I'll fix it.

163
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,380
So E. coli actually does the
last little trick of closing

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,940
that up for you with
its own enzymes for

165
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,630
repairing its own DNA.

166
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,039
I bring this up not because it's
crucial that you should

167
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,690
worry about it, but because I
want to know that there's a

168
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,490
whole layer of these interesting
engineering tricks

169
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,370
that get developed.

170
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,510
Every one of them exploits
enzymes that we know.

171
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,610
Every one of them deals with
questions like, will my vector

172
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,730
reclose on itself, how
do I avoid that?

173
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,230
And there's a vast cooking
book of protocols

174
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,610
in molecular biology.

175
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,230
And we constantly are just
cribbing from things life does

176
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,180
to make our protocols more
and more efficient.

177
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,710
So I bring it up more because
it's kind of a cool thing that

178
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,390
all that goes on, and because
it helps you remember that

179
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,780
these phosphates are
very important to

180
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
joining things up.

181
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,075
That's a digression.

182
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,310
Now, let's go to the topic.

183
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,460
How do we actually
read the library?

184
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,710
How do we read our library?

185
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,350
How do we use the library,
read from the library?

186
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:34,350
Well let's say we're going to
try to find the arginine gene.

187
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,530
We talked about the gene
for arginine in yeast.

188
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,210
So I'd like to clone
the gene for ARG1.

189
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,370
We found mutants before that
were unable to grow without

190
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,880
supplemental arginine.

191
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,070
They somehow had a defect in
producing their own origin.

192
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,760
It's a mutant.

193
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,220
I want to find the
gene, please.

194
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,500
How do I do it?

195
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,400
We've got to think about
what's our insert DNA.

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,410
What are our vectors?

197
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,050
What insert DNA should
we start with, zebra?

198
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
No.

199
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,410
Human?

200
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,370
No.

201
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,110
How about yeast?

202
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,160
We're trying to clone a gene
from yeast, right?

203
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,820
So let's start with yeast.

204
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,380
OK.

205
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,780
So we're going to start
with yeast DNA.

206
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,320
We're going to cut
up yeast DNA.

207
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,330
We're going to attach it to
our vector, we're going to

208
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,100
transform it into E.
coli, E. coli will

209
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,670
grow up on our plates.

210
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,070
And one of these guys, I happen
to know it's that one

211
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,860
there, contains the ARG1 gene.

212
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,320
The problem is I happen to
know it, but you don't.

213
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,420
How are you going to find out
where the ARG1 gene is?

214
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,110
Any takers?

215
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,050
Yeah?

216
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,948
AUDIENCE: It could be like when
you put the gene in make

217
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:12,700
it flourescent.

218
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,440
PROFESSOR: A fluorescent tag?

219
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,580
So I should just attach
the fluorescent

220
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,280
tag to the ARG1 gene?

221
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,160
AUDIENCE: Yes.

222
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,970
PROFESSOR: How do I do that?

223
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,590
All the DNA looks the
same in the tube.

224
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,188
How do I know where to attach
the fluorescent tag?

225
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:28,390
AUDIENCE: Maybe you could
size it [INAUDIBLE].

226
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,530
PROFESSOR: There's a lot
of pieces of DNA there.

227
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,824
And my eyes are not that good.

228
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:33,650
AUDIENCE: Separate it?

229
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,960
PROFESSOR: Separate it.

230
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,810
But will I know which
one is ARG1?

231
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,480
See, I don't actually know
anything about ARG1.

232
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,870
All I know is I made a mutant.

233
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,370
The mutant is unable to
grow without arginine.

234
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,800
I haven't got a clue
what that gene is.

235
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,040
I don't know what it encodes, I
don't know how big it is, I

236
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,550
don't know nothing.

237
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,430
All I know is that whatever it
is, it's a gene which when

238
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,176
mutated prevents you from
growing without arginine.

239
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,032
AUDIENCE: Could you plate all
of your colonies onto a--

240
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,412
could you put [INAUDIBLE]?

241
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,510
PROFESSOR: Minimal medium.

242
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,740
What if I plate on
minimal medium?

243
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Now what?

244
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,665
What are you hoping for?

245
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:14,560
AUDIENCE: The one that has the
ARG1 gene will not grow.

246
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
PROFESSOR: The one that
has the ARG1 gene

247
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,180
won't be able to grow--

248
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,170
oh wait, yeah.

249
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,810
But something like that.

250
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,850
Let's work it through.

251
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,830
We've got my idea here.

252
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,992
What are we going
to do with it?

253
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

254
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,830
PROFESSOR: I've got a working
ARG1 Mutate ARG1 afterwards?

255
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

256
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,200
PROFESSOR: OK.

257
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,350
How will that work?

258
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,170
I'm open for--

259
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,340
got an idea here?

260
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,116
AUDIENCE: If you have your
different colonies

261
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:50,456
[INAUDIBLE], you could have a
secondary plate them all over

262
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:51,440
to one of middle medium.

263
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,160
The ones that die are the ones
that already [INAUDIBLE]--

264
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,850
PROFESSOR: So guys,
I have a concern.

265
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,190
I'm just transferring
this into E. coli.

266
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,490
E.coli grows just fine
without arginine.

267
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,800
I mean, I'm going to take
this yeast DNA.

268
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm going to put
it in E. coli.

269
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,290
E. coli was kind enough
to grow it for me.

270
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,800
But frankly, E. coli doesn't
need this ARG1 gene.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
E. coli can grow without
arginine.

272
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,520
I can plate this with and
without arginine, E. coli

273
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,930
grows just fine.

274
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,150
But you're on to something.

275
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,140
You're onto the idea that
somehow, the only thing we

276
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:34,120
know about ARG1 is that the
functional, wild-type copy of

277
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,570
that gene confers an ability
to grow without arginine.

278
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,110
And who does it confer it on?

279
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,820
And what kind of yeast?

280
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,420
Haploid mutant yeast.

281
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,570
Ah.

282
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,310
So suppose I put a working copy
of ARG1, a good copy, a

283
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,770
wild-type copy, into
a mutant yeast.

284
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,080
Now what would happen to
that mutant yeast?

285
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,780
What would happen?

286
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,260
The mutant yeast before, could
it grow without arginine?

287
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,100
No.

288
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,990
If I put in a working
copy of the ARG1

289
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,650
gene, what will happen?

290
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,320
It grows.

291
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Now let's design a scheme.

292
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,040
Do I want to use
E. coli at all?

293
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,870
No.

294
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,226
What do I want to use?

295
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:35,670
I want to use a yeast.

296
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,330
So let's get rid of E. coli and
let's instead use yeast.

297
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,140
And which yeast should we use,
wild-type or mutant?

298
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,280
Mutant yeast.

299
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
What mutation?

300
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,210
ARG1 mutant yeast.

301
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,000
ARG1 minus yeast.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,740
Now, if I plate ARG1 minus
yeast on minimal

303
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,330
medium, what happens?

304
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,830
It doesn't grow.

305
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,520
It dies.

306
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,585
What DNA should I
be putting in?

307
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,070
Yeast DNA.

308
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,370
Mutant or wild type?

309
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,110
Why wild type?

310
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,070
Because it'll have a working
copy of ARG1.

311
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,600
So I want yeast, wild type.

312
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,410
Now what happens?

313
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,680
One of these guys, and only one
of these guys here, this

314
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,970
one, has a ARG1 gene.

315
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,840
That's ARG1.

316
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:40,720
When it goes in, that plasmid
has the ARG1 plus gene,

317
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,430
whereas other plasmids don't.

318
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,550
That cell that inherits that
gene there, that gets that

319
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,320
gene, is not green.

320
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,050
I just drew it green for you.

321
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,850
But it has the ARG1 gene.

322
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,950
And when I plate this on
minimal medium, what's

323
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,650
distinctive about it?

324
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,280
It grows.

325
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,470
That's how you can clone
the ARG1 gene.

326
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,910
You clone it by the only thing
you know about it.

327
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,520
Namely, it confers a function.

328
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,880
This is called cloning
by function.

329
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:22,290
Or, what did we do when we
crossed two mutants together

330
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,500
to see if things were
in different genes?

331
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,990
It was a test of
complementation.

332
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,040
Really what we're asking is,
is there a plasmid that

333
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,400
complements the defect?

334
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,180
In effect what's happening is
in this cell, right here, we

335
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,760
have a yeast cell.

336
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,470
And the yeast cell has
a defect in its ARG1.

337
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,760
But the plasmid has
a working ARG1.

338
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,140
So for that one gene, this cell
could be thought of maybe

339
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,700
a little bit like a diploid,
just at that one gene.

340
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,569
And we've done a
complementation, just a teeny

341
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,780
little complementation
for one gene.

342
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,920
And we could call this cloning
complementation.

343
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,405
It's essentially cloning
by function.

344
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,190
Any questions?

345
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,884
Yes?

346
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:36,369
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

347
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,345
--they all have functioning
[INAUDIBLE]?

348
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:41,836
PROFESSOR: Yep.

349
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:44,840
AUDIENCE: So why does that
then have a function?

350
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,520
PROFESSOR: Oh, oh.

351
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,800
You see, the yeast genome has
about 4,000 different genes.

352
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,910
I chop it up with my EcoR1.

353
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,090
Some plasmids get ARG1 but most
of them get leucine 2 or

354
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,200
[INAUDIBLE]

355
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,460
or other things.

356
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,040
And each yeast cell in my
library only picks up a

357
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,160
plasmid with one chunk
of DNA, one gene.

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,180
So it turns out that the yeast
cells in my library, each one

359
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,080
has one of thousands of
alternative possibilities.

360
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
And it's just the guy who
gets ARG1 who grows.

361
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,360
AUDIENCE: But you're saying
that the yeast [INAUDIBLE]

362
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,320
plasmid.

363
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,210
All code for--

364
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,780
PROFESSOR: That's right.

365
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,570
AUDIENCE: But I don't get why
you would end up with

366
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,500
[INAUDIBLE].

367
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,250
PROFESSOR: What do I--?

368
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,162
AUDIENCE: Why do you end
up with a strain

369
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,600
that has ARG1 in it?

370
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,090
PROFESSOR: Oh.

371
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,830
ARG1 is the ARG1 working copy.

372
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,350
In the yeast, I'm talking about
this yeast here has the

373
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,160
working copy of ARG1,
ARG1 plus.

374
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,200
So this guy has an ARG1 plus.

375
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,610
It also has lots
of other genes.

376
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,330
Each of these plasmids
gets one gene.

377
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,150
Some of them get an ARG plus.

378
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,500
Some of them happen to get a
leucine gene or some other

379
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,690
gene that's irrelevant.

380
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,544
And the plasmids that contain
the working copy of the gene,

381
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:04,600
they, when they go into the
cell, give the cell the

382
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,930
ability to grow.

383
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,005
So that's why.

384
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:07,710
All right.

385
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,980
So that's how we get
a gene by function.
