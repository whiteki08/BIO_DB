To understand how the light reactions convert solar energy into ATP and NADPH. To understand that the Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions to reduce CO2 to sugar. To understand the relationships between cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Session Activities Lecture Video Watch the lecture video excerpt\nPhotosynthesis Check Yourself Question 1 The light reactions of non-cyclic photophosphorylation supply the Calvin Cycle with… CO2 and ATP close NADPH and ATP check light energy close sugar and O2 close water and sugar close Check Question 2 Which of the following does not occur in the Calvin Cycle? carbon fixation close consumption of ATP close oxidation of NADPH close regeneration of NADP+ close release of oxygen check Check Question 3 Which of the following is not true? The light reactions of cyclic photophosphorylation generate ATP. close The light reactions of cyclic photophosphorylation involve redox reactions. close The light reactions of cyclic photophosphorylation produce NADPH. check The light reactions of cyclic photophosphorylation use chemiosmosis. close The light reactions of cyclic photophosphorylation use only photosystem I. close Check Session Activities Practice Problems Problems (PDF) Solutions (PDF) Further Study Useful Links Photosynthesis Shedding Light on Photosynthesis What is Photosynthesis? « Previous | Next »\n"}
