  "title":"Gene Regulation and the Lac Operon",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview Cells with the same DNA can look and function differently from each other; consider a photoreceptor cell and muscle cell. The difference between these two cells is the result of differential gene expression. Some genes are transcribed and translated in all cells at about the same level, but other genes may be expressed in one cell type but not another. This session will briefly outline some general principles of gene regulation. In addition, a specific example of gene regulation in bacteria will be presented in detail.\nLearning Objectives\nTo recall and understand the different mechanisms working together to regulate the Lac operon. To distinguish positive and negative regulatory mechanisms. To predict the phenotype caused by different mutations within the Lac operon. To justify the benefit to an organism of regulating genes. Session Activities Lecture Video For this session, watch the first 30 minutes of the video lecture called \u0026ldquo;Gene Regulation\u0026rdquo; by Prof. Eric Lander recorded in 2004.\nGene Regulation Check Yourself Question 1 What is the function of the protein encoded by the LacZ gene? Turns glucose into ATP. close Turns glucose into lactose. close Turns glucose into pyruvate. close Turns lactose into glucose and galactose. check Check Question 2 When should E. coli produce beta-galactosidase? High glucose, high lactose. close High glucose, low lactose. close Low glucose, high lactose. check Low glucose, low lactose. close Check Session Activities Help Session Video Watch the short video of Sera Thornton explaining the lac operon.\nThe lac operon Practice Problems Problems (PDF) Solutions (PDF) Further Study Suggested topics for further study in an introductory-level Biology textbook The Lac operon Gene regulation Useful Links lac operon Study Guides Diagram of lac operon (PDF) « Previous | Next »\n"}
